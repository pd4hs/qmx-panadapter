 * with 20 candidates the SAME expensive work ran twenty times over one
 * recording - when all twenty sit inside a 300 Hz window of it.
 *
 * Split in two: decimate 12000 -> 1500 Hz ONCE per capture (stage 1, shared),
 * then per candidate mix the residual offset and decimate 1500 -> 375 Hz on
 * 180,000 samples instead of 1.44 M (stage 2). The per-candidate filter can
 * also be far shorter, because at a 1500 Hz input rate the first band that
 * folds into what the decoder reads starts at 341 Hz - a transition of 0.20
 * normalised instead of 0.026.
 *
 * ⛔ CHECKING THE TWO STAGES SEPARATELY IS NOT ENOUGH, AND THIS IS THE TRAP.
 * Content at +/-750 Hz from the mix centre folds STRAIGHT TO DC in stage 2
 * (750 mod 375 == 0), and stage 1 does not reject it - stage 1's stopband only
 * has to start near 1300 Hz to protect its own +/-200 Hz passband. So the only
 * honest question is the PRODUCT H1*H2 along the path each input frequency
 * actually takes: f1 = wrap(f, 1500) after stage 1, f2 = wrap(f1 - d, 375)
 * after stage 2, contaminating iff |f2| <= 34 Hz. scratchpad/lpf2_design.py
 * computes exactly that, over every candidate offset d the search can produce.
 *
 * Swept, not calculated - the same discipline the single-stage filter needed
 * when a design that was better on both computed axes silently traded PA2PGU
 * for 5B4AHZ:
 *
 *   stage1     stage2    droop    worst alias   per-cand   shared    stations
 *    96/400     32/150   -0.02 dB   -58.2 dB      0.200x    2.40x      (see
 *    96/400     24/120   -0.23 dB   -58.5 dB      0.150x    2.40x     commit)
 *    64/400     24/120   -0.70 dB   -59.0 dB      0.150x    1.60x
 *   (single stage today: 160 taps, -0.58 dB, -53.6 dB, 1.00x, no shared cost)
 *
 * ⚠ STAGE 1 MUST PRESERVE +/-200 Hz, not +/-34. The candidate search runs
 * 1360-1650 Hz around a 1505 Hz centre, so a candidate can sit 145 Hz out, and
 * measure_noise_ref then samples 34 Hz beyond that. Narrowing stage 1 toward
 * what the decoder "reads" would quietly attenuate every off-centre candidate.
 *
 * The centre FOLLOWS the search window (WSPR_WF_LO_HZ/HI_HZ in wspr_rx.h, which
 * went 1350-1650 -> 1360-1650 on 2026-09-11): the middle of it, so both edges
 * keep the same margin inside the +/-200 this stage is built to keep.

 * The reason is that WSPR is continuous-phase FSK: during every symbol
 * transition the tone is sweeping, so real signal energy lands in the other
 * three bins. For a weak signal that is lost in the noise; for a strong one it
 * IS the measurement, and the ratio saturates. A stronger station cannot then
 * report a better SNR, which is exactly the behaviour observed.
 *
 * So the noise is sampled at frequency offsets clear of the transmission -
 * still inside the 50 Hz the decimation filter passes, so it is the same
 * receiver noise through the same path - and combined with a MEDIAN, which is

     * strongest BIN in a neighbourhood, not the frequency of any one station.
     * Measured on the 19:10 reference window, where wsprd finds 14 stations:
     * every one of them has a candidate within ~1 Hz, but THREE of them
     * (G4FBA, PD2LEO, PA5CA - 1471.8, 1472.8, 1474.8 Hz) share a single
     * candidate at 1473.08, and DK8AF and DD3MS share another 2.8 Hz from one
     * of them. So the misses were never "not detected"; they were "detected as
     * somebody else".
     *
     * A single best-sync refinement can only ever return one of a cluster. The
     * sync correlation, though, has a distinct local maximum at EACH real
     * station - it only peaks where four tones line up on the sync vector, so
     * a neighbour 2 Hz away makes its own peak rather than smearing this one.
     * Taking the top few local maxima therefore hands the decoder one
     * hypothesis per station present, which is exactly what it needs.
     *
     * +/-1.5 Hz is a full tone spacing either way. That is far too wide to be
     * safe under "first answer wins" - it reaches neighbouring tones, and a
     * wrong-frequency decode looks just like a right one. It is only usable
     * because the re-encode check below can tell them apart. */

    /* ⛔ BOTH STOOD DOWN 2026-08-27, AND EVERYTHING ABOVE IS THE REASON THIS
     * NOTE EXISTS RATHER THAN A DELETION. Neither guard was wrong. Both were
     * measured carefully, on real data, and both did what they claimed. They
     * are off because the re-encode agreement check (wspr_decode_result_t,
     * WSPR_AGREE_MIN) now does their job better, and because on the current
     * decode path they cost real stations:
     *
     *   SLOW at 1000 cycles rejects THREE wsprd-confirmed decodes - PA4JAM
     *     (1716), PA2PGU (1491), DK8AF (1423). This is precisely the failure
     *     the paragraph above predicts: a cycle count is a property of the
     *     DECODE PATH, and the soft-decision metric is a different path. The
     *     16-hour field measurement that set 1000 was taken on the hard
     *     decision path and no longer describes this one. Re-deriving the
     *     number is possible but pointless when a better test exists.
     *
     *   NEAR at 10 Hz rejects TWO confirmed decodes, and its own premise has
     *     been overtaken: "two WSPR signals closer than ~6 Hz overlap anyway"
     *     was true when a cluster yielded one candidate, but the candidate
     *     finder now resolves them (2E0DLC and OE5OSP are 5.8 Hz apart and
     *     both real; DK8AF and DD3MS are 4 Hz apart and both real).
     *
     * WHAT REPLACES THEM. The LG9TPW fabrication that motivated NEAR was a
     * candidate on a strong signal's skirt - a decode that the received audio
     * does not support, which is exactly what agreement measures. On the noise
     * ladder, four fabrications survived all four guards before; with
     * agreement enforced, none do, while the confirmed count under 1-2 dB of
     * added noise doubled.
     *
     * ⭐ THEY ARE STILL MEASURED ON EVERY DECODE, which is the property the
     * comment above rightly insisted on - so the day one of them is wanted
     * back, the evidence for it is already in an ordinary session's log rather
     * than needing two flashes and two different band conditions.
     *
     * The power guard (>43 dBm, in accept_if_plausible) is untouched: it costs
     * nothing on any measured data and is free to keep. */
