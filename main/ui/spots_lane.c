// marks. An earlier version ran the line upwards from the label to the top of the
// spectrum, which pointed at nothing.
//
// The block is centred rather than started at the middle so the lowest row still
// has room for a usable line: with three rows beginning at mid, row 2 had only
// 25 px left to reach the axis.

// A big ext_click_area on the label could not work: LVGL clips it to the parent,
