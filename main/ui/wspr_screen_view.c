 * sized when the text was "TX  OFF" (~110 px, and the comment at the label's
 * creation still says so). Every string added since is longer:

 *   "TX  ON AIR  FULL PWR"   ~300 px   "FULL PWR" invisible
 *   "TX  in 0:14  FULL PWR"  ~320 px   "FULL PWR" invisible
 *
 * The reported fault was the cosmetic one. The serious one is underneath it:
 * FULL PWR says the PA guard is off while WSPR keys the finals for 110 s in
 * every 120, and it was being clipped away in every single state where it
 * applies - i.e. exactly when it matters. "A protection whose absence is
 * invisible is a protection you cannot trust", as the comment that added it
 * says; a warning clipped off the end of a button is invisible.
 *
 * So the label MEASURES itself and steps the font down until it fits, rather

     * offered on every radio. Exactly the shape of the CW-pitch bug CLAUDE.md

 * already shipped that bug once, where the CW-pitch value was written at ~4.5 s
 * and went nowhere on EVERY boot. So the push stays PENDING until

 *
 * ⛔ AND IT MUST NOT FIGHT THE OPERATOR. Re-pushing continuously would drag the
 * radio back every time someone deliberately tuned off the sub-band. So this is

 *
 * Monospaced by construction (qmx_mono_25) - column arithmetic in characters
 * only means anything in a fixed-advance font. */
/* ---- THE COLUMN BUDGET, because it is exactly full ---------------------
 *
 * qmx_mono_25's advance is 15 px (240 sixteenths - see CELL_W in
 * qmx_term_view.c), and the pane is RIGHT_W = 944 px, so there are exactly
 * 62 characters. Every column below is its own true maximum and the gaps are
 * a single space, which is what "squeeze them together but keep a proper gap"
 * has to mean when the row is already at the edge:
 *
 *   UTC 5 (HH:MM)   CALL 10   GRID 4   COUNTRY 11   SNR 3   DRF 3
 *   HZ 6 (1416.3)   PWR 3     KM 5 (18897)          BRG 3
 *   = 53 + 9 single spaces = 62. Full. Nothing more fits.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing before editing this:
 *  - GRID is 4 because WSPR_SPOT_GRID_MAX is 5. A 6-char grid cannot arrive.
 *  - KM is 5 because the antipode is ~20000 km.
 *  - DRIFT is headed DRF: the word is 5 characters and the data is 3, and
 *    since ONE format string serves header and rows the column would have to
 *    be 5 to hold the title. Abbreviating the title is cheaper than two wasted
 *    columns on every row.
 *  - CALL gets 10 - the struct's whole capacity - because a truncated
 *    CALLSIGN is a wrong identity, which this project does not print. COUNTRY
 *    is allowed to fall back instead of truncating; see country_field().
 *  - The UTC column is blank on all but the first row of a cycle. That still
 *    costs 6 characters, and it is worth it: it replaced a standalone
 *    timestamp line AND a blank line per group, so a 3-spot cycle went from
 *    5 lines to 3. */
/* ⭐ THE CALL COLUMN PAYS FOR THE WIDER LEFT PANEL, AND SEVEN IS WHAT FITS.
 *
 * qmx_mono_25 advances exactly 15.0 px per character, so the pane holds
 * RIGHT_W / 15 = 59 characters; the row was 62 and CALL gives up the three.
 * (I first took them from COUNTRY instead, on the grounds that CALL has no
 * graceful fallback. The operator asked twice for CALL, so CALL it is - and
 * MEASURING the font rather than estimating it is what made 7 possible where
 * a guess had said 6.)
 *
 * ⚠ Seven is not arbitrary and it is not free. Every callsign in a live 25-
 * station sample from this bench is six characters or fewer, so the table
 * aligns in practice - but a COMPOUND call (BH4RRG/QRP is ten) still prints in
 * full and pushes that row's later columns right. printf does not truncate,
 * and it must not: a clipped callsign is a different station.
 *
 * ⛔ THE WIDTHS ARE DEFINED ONCE AND THE FORMAT IS BUILT FROM THEM. Every
 * column width used to appear twice - in ROW_FMT and again wherever the field
 * was prepared - and that drift has already caused two bugs in one evening
 * (COUNTRY_W left at 11 when the format went to 7, then the reverse). A
 * stringified constant cannot disagree with itself. */

     *
     * This started at 28 under a comment asserting that "MODE: WSPR" could not
     * fit at 48 because it is one character longer than the FT8 page's
     * "MODE: FT8". That was an ESTIMATE (~296 px against 288 available) written
     * as if it were a fact, and it cost the page a header two sizes smaller
     * than every other mode's for no established reason. The operator asked why
     * it looked odd next to the other pages, which was the right question.
     *
     * It also compared against the wrong budget. The controls below use a 16 px
     * margin, but a title is not a control and need not share it: the decode
     * list starts at RIGHT_X (LEFT_W + 8), so the header can have the panel's
     * full width and still clear it.
     *
     * So: try the big font, ASK LVGL how wide the text actually is, and step
     * down only if it genuinely does not fit. Same pattern as the bottom bar's
     * version label in ui.c. That way this page matches the others whenever it
     * can, and can never spill into the CALL column when it cannot. */
    /* 48, the same as every other mode page, and it DOES NOT FIT in the panel.
     *
     * Measured at runtime rather than guessed: "MODE: WSPR" renders about
     * 336 px at 48 pt against this panel's 320. "MODE: FT8" is one character
     * shorter, ~302 px, which is exactly why the other pages fit and this one
     * cannot. Two alternatives were built and rejected by the operator - a
     * smaller font, and splitting "MODE:" off at 20 so only the name was large.
     * His call, made with the constraint in front of him: consistency with the
     * other pages matters more than the overlap, "if it then lap over the wf
     * window then so be it".
     *
     * So it is foregrounded deliberately. The waterfall canvas is created after
     * this label and LVGL draws siblings in creation order, so without this the
     * title would be drawn UNDER the waterfall and simply disappear - the

     *
     * ⛔ BELOW THE LINE, NEVER ON IT (operator, 2026-09-08: "right now you
     * write on top of the dashed line and one can be in doubt what to assign
     * them to"). A boundary is BETWEEN two cycles, so a glyph straddling it

     * wf_mark_boundary() runs after a cycle's rows are published and row 0 is

     * carries that cycle's own UTC time at its left end, so it can be matched
     * to a UTC group in the list without counting boundaries.
     *
     * ⚠ If the boundary has scrolled far enough down that the row will not fit
     * beneath it, the labels are HIDDEN. The alternative is clamping, which
     * puts them back above the line - onto the wrong cycle, silently, exactly
     * when they are hardest to check.
     *
     * ⛔⛔ AND THE SAME LIE ARRIVED BY A SECOND ROUTE, WHICH THE PARAGRAPH
     * ABOVE DID NOT COVER (operator screenshots, 2026-09-09). The scan below
     * finds the FIRST mark row from the top, which is always the NEWEST
     * boundary - but the marks in hand are whatever last finished DECODING,
     * and a window is decoded while the next one is already recording. So for
     * roughly the first 80 s of every cycle the letters and the time sat under
     * a line belonging to a different cycle, then jumped when the decode
     * landed. Three consecutive frames caught the whole sequence: 14:36 marks
     * under the line closing 14:38, then 14:38 correctly, then 14:38 again
     * under the line closing 14:40 with its own rows already scrolled off.
     * WSPR_WF_CYCLES is 1, so there is only ever ONE line on screen and there
     * is no older one to move them to - the honest answer is to draw them only
     * while the line on screen is their own, and otherwise not at all.
     *
     * ⭐ THE TIME IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THAT and is now drawn from

             * vanished with it.
             *
             * So it comes back from the honest source: the time to the next
             * even minute, which is when a burst may start. It says "next"
             * rather than promising one, because the duty cycle is a random
             * roll taken at the boundary - at 50 % roughly every other slot
             * transmits, and claiming a burst that then does not happen would
             * be worse than saying nothing. */
