// WHY A TABLE AND NOT CALL SITES SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
// Every help affordance - the drawer's User Manual button, a tappable warning
// banner, the term index - resolves to one of these IDs, so there is exactly one
// place that knows which manual page covers what. That matters because the manual
// is regenerated from docs/mkdocs/** on every build: `tools/pack_manual.py`
// verifies each page path exists in the blob and each anchor matches a real
// heading, and FAILS THE BUILD otherwise. Deep links that rot silently are worse
// than no deep links, because the operator stops trusting them.
//
// The anchor is a case-insensitive SUBSTRING of the heading, so "Tap to Tune"
// matches "### 2. Tap to Tune" and survives renumbering.

// Triage: "what's wrong?" as a short, ranked list of SYMPTOMS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A fixed problem menu fails the way FAQ pages fail - a novice cannot map what
// they SEE onto our vocabulary. So the rows are phrased in the first person as
// observable symptoms ("Nothing appears in the decode list"), never as system
// concepts ("no CAT link"), and the list is RANKED from live device state:
// cat_is_ready(), wifi_is_connected(), the decode count, the IQ-confirmed flag.
// Rows the device can see are actually happening float to the top and are marked
// `flagged`; the rest are the usual questions for whichever screen is open.
//
// THE RULE THIS MUST NOT BREAK: the device RANKS, the operator CHOOSES. Never
// auto-navigate on inference, however confident. A wrong guess that costs one tap
// is fine; one that hijacks the screen is the exact bug that made opening the
// drawer land in the troubleshooting chapter (see the QMX-wait label in ui.c).

// The list scrolls, so this is the size of the CANDIDATE POOL rather than what fits
// on screen (about five rows are visible at a time). Raise it freely when adding
// rows - the cost is one hidden widget each.
//
// 2026-09-13: the SelfSpotter audit added enough new rows (radio menus, still
// spectrum, sim mode, SWR protection, Antenna Tune, RIT, release-radio, the
// spot map's two, WSPR's own) that 16 was no longer a candidate-pool margin
// on the panadapter screen, it was a hard cut - two rows added earlier that
// evening never reached the visible list because everything ahead of them in
// s_cands[] already filled it. 24 is comfortably past every screen's current
// row count with room to keep adding.
