 * docs/wspr-ui-design.md - in particular why this looks different from the FT8
 * screen rather than the same, which is the protocol's doing and not a
 * preference:
 *
 *   - the rhythm is TWO MINUTES, so the countdown orients rather than urges
 *   - it is a one-way beacon, so there is no QSO furniture at all
 *   - the list is a LOG grouped by cycle, not a live "who is on frequency now"
 *   - there is no MESSAGE column, because there is no message

/* ---- THE STANDARD WSPR DIALS, AND WHICH OF THEM THIS RADIO HAS ------------
 *
 * The dial frequencies are a property of the PROTOCOL - every band has exactly
 * one canonical WSPR sub-band and anything else is simply not where anyone is
 * listening. Which bands are REACHABLE is a property of this particular radio:
 * a QMX is built with a fixed set of band-pass filters, and the one on this
 * bench reports 60/40/30/20/17/15 while a QMX+ covers 160-6.
 *
 * So the table is fixed and the AVAILABILITY is asked of the radio
 * (cat_get_band_list). Offering a band the hardware cannot filter would be
 * offering a dial that receives nothing.
