// real fix (parity-aware aging pause, #46). 120 -> 90 (2026-07-19) once the
// #51 ISO-pipeline fix restored ~16 unique decodes/slot: 120 s now keeps far
// too large a crowd on screen, so 90 s tightens "Active" back to who is
// genuinely here now. Tunable - and now literally tunable, by the operator,
// from the Filter modal's "Max age in list" dropdown (30/45/60/75/90 s);

// Hard ceiling on the parity-aware aging PAUSE above. The pause itself is right
// - while we transmit over a station's slot its silence tells us nothing - but it
// had no upper bound, and during a CQ run we are parity-locked essentially all
// the time. So every row on our TX parity was kept FOREVER: ten minutes, an
// hour, whatever the session lasted.
//
// That is not cosmetic. build_tone_occupancy() (ft8_tx.c) reads this same table
// and filters it to OUR parity - precisely the rows being retained - so the
// occupancy strip filled up and stayed full, the automatic picker ran out of
// "free" tones, and only a restart cleared it. Field-reported by Roy KI0ER
// (2026-08-05): "the offset strip turns totally red ... all slots taken", cured
// by restarting, which is exactly what an unbounded retain looks like.
//
// 10 minutes: long enough to ride out any realistic CQ run or exchange without
// the list churning, short enough that a station who left is not still claiming
// a frequency. A stale "occupied" is worse than a missing row - it steers us
// away from a tone that is actually free.

/* ⭐ 11,264 BYTES OF INTERNAL DIRAM, AND THE LAST ft8_call_t ARRAY STILL IN IT.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md's 2026-08-05 audit moved the two `static ft8_call_t snap[]`
 * heard-table snapshots (11.25 KB each) to PSRAM and named THIS one as "the
 * next candidate" - it was measured, written down, and then never actioned.
 * `nm --size-sort` on 2026-09-17 still had it third in internal DIRAM, behind
 * only audio.c's raw[]/decoded[], which are deliberately internal.
 *
 * Why it is safe here and not for audio.c's buffers: this table is touched a
 * few tens of times per 15 s slot (once per decode, plus a list rebuild), NOT
 * per sample. It is also mutex-protected, which by itself proves no ISR
 * touches it - you cannot take a mutex in one. v0.19.4's finding that a PSRAM
 * spill makes the STFT ~10x slower is about the FFT inner loop; nothing in
 * this file is in that class.
 *
 * Context for why 11 KB matters at all: the DMA-capable pool on this board is
 * carved out of the same DIRAM, and a capture on 2026-09-17 caught it at
 * `DMA free=231 lblk=32` with 353 logged `esp_dma_capable_malloc(): Not enough
 * heap memory` failures - the state CLAUDE.md already records as the one that
 * breaks TLS, USB endpoint allocation and the SD card. */

// The decode list's order is a POLICY - "what is the operator looking for" -
// and it now has two consumers: the Tab5's own list (ft8_screen_view.c) and the
// browser's (net/webserver.c /api/decodes). Two copies would drift, and the
// first symptom would be the two screens disagreeing about which station is at
// the top during a QSO, which is exactly what the pin was added to fix.
//
// The tiers, most wanted first:
//   1. the station we are working  - their reply, their CQ, even a message they
//      send to a third station, which is when you most want to see them
//   2. anything addressed to us
//   3. CQ calls
//   4. everything else, strongest signal first
//
// qsort() takes no context pointer, so the two keys live in file statics - which
// is why this function owns a mutex rather than exposing a bare comparator: the
// LVGL thread and the HTTP task must not be mid-sort in each other's keys.
