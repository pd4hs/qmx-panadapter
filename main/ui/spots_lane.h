// Source colours, shared with the settings-drawer checkboxes (ui.c's
// DRAWER_SEC_SPOTS) so a checkbox's label text and the spot it toggles can
// never show two different colours for the same thing. POTA/DX-cluster/SOTA
// all currently share COL_POTA - see spots_lane.c's own comment on the
// colour table for why (no source-specific hue exists yet for the latter
// two). Defined here rather than left file-local in spots_lane.c precisely
// so a second file can reference them instead of re-typing the hex.

// Live POTA/RBN spots drawn at their frequency as a SEE-THROUGH overlay on the
// spectrum - the FlexRadio/SmartSDR convention: a bright callsign with a thin
// vertical line dropping from it to the frequency axis, so the line points at the
// frequency the spot is on.
//
// This replaced a dedicated 36 px strip between the spectrum and the frequency
// axis (operator's call, 2026-08-05, after seeing both). The overlay is the
// better trade: it reads the way every other panadapter does, and it gives those
// 36 px back to the waterfall.
//
// The callsign block is centred on the middle of the spectrum and the lines run
// from there DOWN to the axis. See-through comes from the line being 2 px wide
// rather than from dimming it - line and callsign are drawn at the same opacity
// so they read as one object.
//
// Implementation note that matters: the spots are LVGL objects composited over
// the spectrum canvas, NOT drawn into it. The render task rewrites that canvas
// at 30 Hz, so anything drawn in would be erased on the next frame.
//
// The overlay container is deliberately NOT clickable, and only the callsign
// labels are - otherwise a transparent object covering the whole spectrum would
// swallow tap-to-tune and pinch-zoom. Tapping the callsign itself is also how
// Flex does it.
//
// The visible window is fed in by ui.c from update_freq_axis_labels(), so the x
// mapping is the SAME one the axis labels use. If the two ever drifted, a spot
// would point at the wrong frequency under a correct axis - the one failure mode
// that makes this feature worse than not having it.

// Build the overlay. (x spans the display; `y`/`h` are the spectrum's own rect.)
