// v0.13.0: FT8 QSO state machine - auto search-and-pounce + CQ-run.
//
// Two roles, one machine. The third field of a standard FT8 message decides
// the flow:
//
//   POUNCE (we answered their CQ)               CQ-RUN (they answered our CQ)
//   ------------------------------------        --------------------------------
//   TX1 <them> <me> <my_grid>                   CQ  CQ <me> <my_grid>
//   RX  <me> <them> <report>                    RX  <me> <them> <their_grid|rpt>
//   TX2 <them> <me> R<report>                   TX  <them> <me> <report>
//   RX  <me> <them> RR73|73                     RX  <me> <them> R<report>
//   TX3 <them> <me> 73                          TX  <them> <me> RR73
//
// Patience: the "current outgoing message" (s_cur_req) is re-armed every TX
// slot - by ft8_qso_on_tx_complete() right after each burst - until either the
// expected reply is heard (progress: swap s_cur_req, reset the miss counter) or
// QSO_TIMEOUT_SLOTS consecutive RX slots pass with no progress. So we keep
// pushing the same call for several cycles rather than going silent after one
// transmission. On timeout a CQ-originated QSO falls back to calling CQ again;
// a pounce QSO goes to TIMEOUT (sticky).
//
// Arming is deferred: ft8_qso_advance() runs in the decode task ~4 s into the
// *next* slot, which is usually while our re-armed burst is already ACTIVE on
// air - so advance() only updates state + s_cur_req, and on_tx_complete() (or
// the idle fallback) does the actual ft8_tx_arm(). This avoids the
// "arm refused, burst already in progress" race that previously left CQ stuck.

// The decode list greys a row whenever adif_log_contains_call_on_band() says we
// have logged that station on this band - UNCONDITIONALLY. Every ENGINE path
// skipped the same station only `if (excl_worked_before && ...)`. So on the
// default the screen said "worked" in dim grey and the machine called them
// again anyway: *"When I finish a QSO and his callsign turns gray, he calls
// again shortly after - as if there was no previous completed QSO."*
//
// Two field reports of one behaviour is evidence the default is wrong, not that
// two operators misconfigured it. But the checkbox is not simply wrong either -
// an operator may legitimately want to re-work a station later, after a band
// opening changes. So the fix is bounded in TIME rather than absolute: the
// UNATTENDED pickers never re-work a station logged on this band within
// RECENT_WORKED_GRACE_SEC, whatever the checkbox says, and beyond that window
// the checkbox rules exactly as before.
//
// ⭐ There is a second, harder reason this must be unconditional. The duplicate
// guard above REFUSES TO LOG a repeat inside QSO_DUP_LOG_WINDOW_SEC - so
// without this, the machine transmits a complete exchange, keys the radio for
// ~12.6 s per burst, and then throws the result away. Working a contact we have
// already decided not to log is worse than declining to work it.
//
// ⚠ RAM-only, deliberately. It answers "did we work them in this session,
// recently", which is exactly the reported symptom; the ADIF log (via the
// checkbox) still covers everything older. A reboot clearing it is harmless
// because the grace is minutes, not days. A ring rather than one slot because
// the existing s_logged_* is a single entry - fine for the dup guard, useless
// here the moment one other station is worked in between.
// Extracted to main/ft8_recent.c so test/ft8_recent_harness.c can link the real
// functions and step the clock at will. That was not gold-plating: the on-device
// route needs a completed QSO, and in FT8 simulation mode on 2026-08-28 the
// decode ran 15.4 s against a 15 s slot, so slots overran 2x and the robot never

// On a busy band several stations answer the same CQ and the caller picks one.
// If that isn't us, we used to keep re-sending TX1 at them for QSO_TIMEOUT_SLOTS
// slots while they were visibly mid-exchange with a third party - six ~12.6 s
// full-power bursts nobody could answer - and then grey-list them, which is a
// false positive: the grey-list is for stations that can't HEAR us, not ones
// that are merely busy. So while their latest message is addressed to somebody
// else we hold: no transmission, and no missed-slot count (so no timeout and no
// grey-listing). When they sign off (73/RR73) or CQ again, we resume.
//
// Bounded on purpose. Holding forever would be its own bug - a station that
// simply vanishes mid-sentence must still time out - and an unbounded hold that
// kept re-transmitting would be WORSE for battery than timing out. 24 slots is
// ~6 min, comfortably longer than a full exchange plus slack.

// message to their callsign." He is right - FT8 decoders work the whole

     * means it should call at all. partner_busy_with() already existed and was
     * consulted once a QSO was RUNNING; it was never consulted when picking.
     *
     * ⚠ CHECKED ON THE WINNER, NOT INSIDE THE SELECTION LOOP. partner_busy_with()
     * allocates ~11 KB of PSRAM and snapshots the whole call table under the
     * screen mutex; calling it for every one of up to FT8_PILEUP_MAX entries
     * would do that twelve times in a burst on the decode task, which is the
     * shape CLAUDE.md warns about for the cyan flash. Exclude-and-repick costs
     * ONE call in the ordinary case and never more than it would have.
     *
     * The deeper cause is a premise that stopped being true: ft8_pileup.h has no
     * expiry and justifies it as "nothing in this module ever arms a TX", which
     * was sound while a human chose from the list and could see they were busy.
     * Auto-work-pileup was built on top later without revisiting that. */

    // up on the contact. Roy KI0ER lost QSOs to exactly this: the first caller
    // worked fine, the second (picked up from the pileup after that QSO logged)
    // was answered with a grid.
    //
    // Passing the report as `extra` is the whole fix: ft8_qso_start() already
    // detects a REPLY whose third field is a "+NN"/"-NN" token, arms it
    // unchanged and starts in WAIT_ROGER - the same shape and state
    // cqrun_answer() uses. That path was added for the pileup MODAL (Ken
    // KF0AYY, 2026-07-15) and this automatic drain was never moved onto it.
    // ⭐ BUILD THE REPLY FROM WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SENT, through the one builder
    // that has been right every time (#172).
    //
    // This used to always send a BARE report and start in WAIT_ROGER. That is
    // correct for a caller who sent a grid, and wrong for the experienced
    // operator who reported US instead - he needs R<report> and WAIT_RR73. It
    // could not be a one-line branch either, because ft8_pileup_entry_t records
    // call/snr/freq/last_seen and NOT what they sent, so the drain had no way to
    // tell the two apart.
    //
    // So look them up in the heard table and hand it to
    // ft8_qso_build_manual_reply(), which derives the whole ladder from
    // last_text. This removes the SECOND message-building path rather than
    // patching it a third time - the same shape had already been fixed in the
    // pileup modal (#134, sent a grid) and in cqrun_answer() (#167, sent a bare
    // report), and each fix left the others standing. One path cannot disagree
    // with itself.
    //
    // Safe from the decode task: that function touches no LVGL objects (its
    // header note describes its original caller, not a hard constraint) and its
    // one qmx_settings_t is the same load this function already does.
    // ⚠ ONLY build from the heard text if it is ADDRESSED TO US - found by testing
    // this in sim, where it was masked by a setting.
    //
    // The pileup exists because these stations called US. But the heard table
    // holds their LATEST message, and a caller who gave up has usually gone back
    // to calling CQ - so building from last_text would answer a pileup caller
    // with a grid TX1, which is exactly the #134 bug the report-first logic was
    // written to prevent ("Roy KI0ER lost QSOs to exactly this"). The sim run
    // showed 'auto-pileup N5XYZ: replying to CQ N5XYZ EM12' and still produced a
    // report - but only because Skip-TX1 happened to be ON, which turns a CQ
    // answer into a report anyway. With it off the grid would have gone out.
    //
    // So: their message to us decides the rung (grid -> report, report ->
    // R-report, which is the whole point of #172); anything else falls through to

 * message on every slot and transmitting the exchange ON THE NEW BAND, to a

 * and nothing else on the radio would carry on regardless.

 * ⛔ Deliberately NOT gated on "was the robot running". A hand-started pounce
 * transmits on the wrong band just as readily as an automatic one, and the
