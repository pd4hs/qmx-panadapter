/* WSPR audio-domain decode: turn 12000 Hz mono PCM samples into decoded
 * WSPR type-1 messages, on top of the protocol/FEC layer in wspr_proto.h /
 * wspr_fano.h.
 *
 * Portable on purpose (no ESP deps) so test/wspr_decode_harness.c can link
 * the REAL functions against a real captured WSPR WAV file - same
 * convention as every other module here. Proven against WSJT's own
 * official WSPR sample recording (test/wav_reference/wspr/150426_0918.wav,
 * from sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt/files/samples/WSPR/): 5 of 8 detected
 * candidates decode cleanly to standard-format US callsigns with legal
 * WSPR power values and fast Fano convergence (82-102 cycles); the other 3
 * are correctly rejected as implausible (see wspr_decode.c for the three
 * checks and why each exists).
 *
 * RESOLVED: why the file's own STRONGEST candidate still fails. Real
 * ionospheric fading (QSB) within the 110 s transmission - not a bug, not
 * frequency drift (tested and ruled out), not a second overlapping signal.
 * See test/wspr_diag_candidate0.c and docs/wspr-phase1-status.md for the
 * full diagnosis (sync-match rate climbing from ~55% to ~85% across the
 * transmission, total power rising ~20x, a clean single frequency peak).
 *
 * Per-symbol reliability-weighted decoding (wspr_fano_decode_weighted(),
 * main/wspr_fano.c/.h) was built and shipped as a FALLBACK specifically to
 * target this: it measurably beats hard-decision at moderate fading (10/10
 * vs 9/10 across seeds, test/wspr_fading_harness.c), but even oracle
 * (ground-truth) weighting cannot recover THIS candidate's severity -
 * confirmed a genuine information-theoretic limit, not a tuning gap. Hard-
 * decision stays the primary path (no calibration fragility); weighted is
 * tried only when hard-decision doesn't produce a plausible result.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATIONS (next work, not silently glossed over):
 *  - No frequency-drift compensation - tested against the one candidate
 *    that seemed like a plausible drift case and ruled out (see above);
 *    may still matter for a different real signal never captured yet.
 *  - Whole-capture soft-decision metrics (as opposed to the per-symbol
 *    weighted fallback above) were tried twice and NOT shipped - see
 *    docs/wspr-phase1-status.md's licensing section and the two "soft
 *    metric" update entries for why (a fixed-scale table was too narrow;
 *    a per-capture-normalized one worked synthetically but regressed the
 *    real WAV 5/8 -> 1/8).
 *  - The plausibility checks (message shape, legal power, Fano cycle
 *    count) are a proxy for signal quality, not a real quality metric
 *    (sync correlation vs. noise floor, the way wsprd itself gates
 *    candidates). Good enough to reject a wrong decode in testing so far,
 *    not yet validated against a genuinely weak/marginal real signal.

     * back to its 162 channel symbols and asks whether the RECEIVED audio
     * actually said that. Every other check in accept_if_plausible() is
     * self-consistency of the message; these two are the only ones that
     * consult the signal.
     *
     * agree_hard: fraction of the 162 symbols whose hard decision matches the
     *   re-encoded bit. Blunt but absolute.
     * agree_soft: the same comparison weighted by how strongly each symbol
     *   argued, in units of the capture's own soft-symbol spread. Sensitive
     *   where agree_hard saturates - at threshold a TRUE decode still has
     *   plenty of wrong hard bits, which is the entire reason the code exists.

/* ---- FALSE-DECODE GUARDS -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * wspr_decode_candidate()'s own checks (message shape, legal power, repack
 * round-trip, cycles <= WSPR_CYCLES_SUSPECT) are not sufficient. Simulation
 * mode produced a counterexample on hardware: with a purely synthetic window
 * containing six phantom stations and nothing else, the decoder emitted a
 * SEVENTH station -
 *
 *     DECODED 'LG9TPW' 'FQ54' 17 dBm  f=1442.23 Hz dt=4.76s cycles=1534
 *
 * - which passed every check. 17 dBm is a legal power, the callsign and grid
 * are well formed, and 1534 is inside the 2000 threshold. It sat 6.6 Hz from
 * a genuine decode at 1448.82 Hz, i.e. about one WSPR signal bandwidth: a
 * candidate on a strong signal's skirt.
 *
 * This matters more than a display artefact. A WSPR spot is a RECEPTION
 * REPORT, and publishing a station that was never on the air is a fabricated
 * measurement - the thing this project refuses to do anywhere else (see the
 * RST placeholder and PSK Reporter callsign rules in CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * Two guards, deliberately INDEPENDENT, because they trade differently and
 * which one is right cannot be settled on synthetic audio:
 *
 *   NEAR - reject a decode within near_hz of one already accepted this cycle.
 *          Surgical. Two WSPR signals closer than ~6 Hz overlap anyway, so it
 *          should cost no real decode.
 *   SLOW - reject a decode needing more than slow_cycles Fano cycles. Blunt.
 *          Every genuine decode observed so far converged in 81-102 cycles
 *          (5 real signals in the reference WAV, 6 synthetic phantoms), but
 *          synthetic phantoms are clean and say nothing about weak real
 *          signals, so this could cost sensitivity.
 *
 * ⭐ BOTH ARE ALWAYS MEASURED, whether or not they are enforced. A guard that
 * only acts when enabled can never be compared against the alternative on the
 * SAME signals - it would need two flashes and two different band conditions.
 * Measuring both on every decode means one ordinary receiving session
 * accumulates the evidence to decide, which is the whole point. */

#define WSPR_GUARD_NEAR_HZ      10.0   /* ~1.5x a WSPR signal's ~6 Hz width */
/* 1000, and ENFORCED as of 2026-08-25 - see wspr_guards_defaults() for the two
 * runs that justify enforcing it at all.
 *
 * ⚠ THE NUMBER WAS 600 FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THAT WAS WRONG, from stale
 * measurements: the cycle counts used to pick it came from BEFORE the
 * windowed-sinc decimation filter landed, and the new filter moves them. The
 * same wsprd-confirmed station (PA3BCA, 19:06 reference window) went from 336
 * cycles pre-filter to 823 post-filter, so 600 would have rejected a decode
 * another implementation calls real.
 *
 * ⭐ GENERALISE THAT: a Fano cycle count is a property of the DECODE PATH, not
 * of the signal. Any change to the front end - filter, decimation, metric -
 * invalidates every threshold expressed in cycles. Re-measure against
 * test/wav_reference/wspr/ before trusting one.
 *
 * 1000 clears the highest confirmed-real decode observed on the current path
 * (823) with margin, still rejects 68 of 112 slow one-offs across 16 h of
 * running, and loses nothing anywhere in the data. */
