/* WSPR spot store - the data layer behind the Phase 3 UI.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT modelled on ft8_screen.c's call table, and the difference is
 * the protocol's, not a preference:
 *
 *   FT8's table is keyed by CALLSIGN and merged, because its list answers "who
 *   is on frequency right now" and a station heard five times is still one row.
 *
 *   A WSPR store is a LOG. Spots arrive in a burst every two minutes and the
 *   same station heard in six consecutive cycles at six different SNRs is the
 *   entire point - that sequence IS the propagation measurement. Merging it
 *   away would delete the information the mode exists to produce.
 *
 * So this is a ring of individual spots, newest first, never merged.
 *
 * ⛔ The backing store lives in PSRAM and callers must NOT put a snapshot on
 * the stack - the same rule ft8_screen.h carries, for the same reason (see the
 * v0.20.1 pounce crash: an 11 KB stack array on an LVGL callback). Use
 * wspr_spots_count() when only the number is wanted, and copy at most a screen
 * full when rendering.
