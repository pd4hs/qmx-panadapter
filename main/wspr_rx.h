/* ⭐ IS THE WSPR PAGE REACHABLE AT ALL?
 *
 * WSPR rides the main track before it is finished, so the release carries the
 * code - and the OTA path that delivers it can be exercised - while nobody
 * meets a half-built mode by accident. Every gate in the firmware asks THIS
 * function rather than reading the setting itself, so the swipe cycle, the web
 * screen switch, /api/wspr and the RX loop cannot drift apart about what "off"
 * means. One of them disagreeing is how a feature ends up half-reachable.
 *
 * ⚠ OFF DOES NOT MEAN FREE. .bss is allocated whether the code runs or not.
 * WSPR's internal-RAM share was dealt with separately; see the
 * EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR note in wspr_rx.c. Do not reason from this flag to memory.

/* WSPR receive slot loop.
 *
 * Captures the even-minute window from the live IQ stream, decodes it with the
 * decoder proven in docs/wspr-phase1-status.md, and files what it finds in
 * wspr_spots.
 *
 * ⭐ IT DECODES EVERY CYCLE. It did not always: the first cut captured for the
 * whole 120 s and then decoded sequentially, and the decode measured 64 s on
 * this silicon, so the task was still working when the next window opened and
 * could not arm it - half rate, by construction, and documented here as a real
 * limitation rather than a rough edge. The decoder has since been made several
 * times faster and the capture now runs against the next window while the
 * previous one is decoded. Confirmed on the bench 2026-08-28, where /api/wspr
 * reported "captur. 35/120 s | dec 20/20" - capturing and decoding at once -
 * and the operator had already tested both cycles independently.
 *
 * Entering this mode sets ui_mode to UI_MODE_WSPR, which diverts the DSP's IQ
 * chain into the capture pre-ring exactly as FT8 mode does. The panadapter's
 * spectrum and waterfall are unavailable while it runs - the receiver has the
 * IQ stream for the whole cycle - which is why /api/wspr reports the loop's

 * pre-ring instead of the panadapter FFT, and a capture fills 120 s of every
 * 120 s cycle. A live spectrum would therefore be frozen for exactly the time
 * it matters.
 *
 * So the waterfall is built FROM THE CAPTURED WINDOW after each cycle, which is
 * what WSJT-X shows for WSPR anyway. One row per symbol period and 1.4648 Hz
 * bins - an 8192-point FFT at 12 kHz gives exactly one bin per WSPR tone
 * spacing - so each transmission reads as a clean vertical trace.

/* ⛔ 1350-1650, AND IT WENT TO 1380-1600 FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE COMING BACK.
 *
 * The narrowing looked well-founded: 484 decodes from one evening on this bench
 * ran 1389.58 to 1611.35, with 76 in 1375-1400 and exactly ONE above 1600, so
 * the outer 80 Hz appeared to be carrying nothing. It spreads the pane nicely -
 * 4.29 px/Hz against 3.15, so a 4.4 Hz signal is 19 px wide instead of 14.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT WAS STILL WRONG, because a night's decodes measure WHAT WE DECODED,
 * not what is on the band. The operator watched the wider carpet and saw
 * signals out at both edges - traces we were never going to decode and now
 * would not even draw. A display that only shows what already worked cannot
 * show you what is being missed, which on a page whose whole job is showing the
 * band is the wrong way round.
 *
 * Generalise it: do not size a DISPLAY window from the distribution of
 * SUCCESSES. That is the same trap as a change-detected repaint keyed on only
 * part of what the render reads.

 * 1360-1650 since 2026-09-11 (operator). It went to 1330-1630 for an hour

 * a wild CW transmitter - the same lesson as above from the other side: check
 * what a trace IS before moving the window to include it. The search window in
 * wspr_rx.c and the decoder's stage-1 centre in wspr_decode.c follow this -
 * see both.
 *
 * ⚠ WSPR_WF_COLS must be (HI - LO) / 1.4648, rounded: the view maps columns to
 * pixels and the axis maps Hz to pixels, and they only agree if the columns
 * span exactly this window. A literal because it sizes static arrays. */

/* ---- THE CARPET FLOWS, IT DOES NOT REDRAW ------------------------------
 *
 * The first version cleared the buffer at the start of every capture and
 * filled rows 0 -> 175 downward, so the page went black, dripped a picture
 * over 120 s, froze for the decode, and went black again. Two things were
 * wrong with that and the operator named both.
 *
 * 1. TIME RAN THE WRONG WAY. Row 0 was the oldest and new rows pushed
 *    DOWNWARD, while the panadapter waterfall in this same firmware puts the
 *    newest row at the TOP (see the layout block in CLAUDE.md). Two
 *    waterfalls on one device disagreeing about which way time flows is an
 *    inconsistency, not a preference.
 *
 * 2. ONE CYCLE EXACTLY FILLED THE PANE, so there was nowhere for history to
 *    go. WSPR is a mode you read over many cycles - the question is always
 *    "is this station coming back", which a single window cannot answer.
 *
 * So this is a RING of two cycles' worth of rows, newest first, and nothing
 * is ever blanked. The row period stays at one WSPR symbol (0.6827 s)
 * because THE ROW PERIOD IS THE FLOW RATE: averaging symbols together to buy
 * more history would make the carpet advance in visible jerks, which is the
 * exact quality being asked for. It is also what keeps the 8192-point FFT at
 * one bin per WSPR tone spacing. History comes from the ring being deeper
 * than the pane, and the view's nearest-neighbour rowmap squeezes it into
 * the 200 px available - a 110 s trace is ~160 rows, so it survives that
 * easily. */
/* ONE cycle fills the pane. Two was tried first and the arithmetic killed it:
 * 352 rows in a 200 px pane makes each row 0.57 px, so at WSPR's 1.47 rows/s
 * the carpet crawled at 0.83 px/s and took ~6 minutes to fill from black.
 * At one cycle each row is 1.14 px and it moves at 1.67 px/s - twice as fast -
 * and the pane is full after a single 120 s capture. History lives in the
 * decode list, which is the right place for it: the list says WHAT was heard,
 * the carpet shows the band NOW. */
/* ⭐ THREE MINUTES, NOT TWO (operator, 2026-09-09). With the candidate cap
 * raised the letters were reaching the bottom of the pane before the cycle
 * had finished decoding, so the carpet was scrolling away the very thing it
 * had just been given.
 *
 * The old objection to more history was 352 rows squeezed into a 200 px pane
 * - 0.57 px per row, a carpet crawling at 0.83 px/s and six minutes to fill
 * from black. That was TWO cycles into the OLD pane. This is one and a half
 * cycles into a pane that also grew 25 %, which comes out at 0.95 px/row and
 * 1.39 px/s - slower than the 1.67 px/s of before, and nowhere near the crawl
