//
// "It would be quite a luxury to add a menu option to Not Zero-Beat CW Reply
// ... such that whatever frequency I tune to via the Panadapter for RX, my
// effective TX frequency will add that predefined offset." The point is QRP
// courtesy and audibility: everyone answering a CW CQ zero-beat arrives as one
// mud-pit, and a station slightly off stands out.
//
// "SLIGHTLY" IS THE WHOLE POINT, and the figure in this comment used to be
// 400-600 Hz, which was wrong twice over. Roy KI0ER retracted his own original
// number ("I forgot to divide by 2") and Michael KZ4LY explained why it cannot be
// right: you are trying to land INSIDE the other station's filter, and most CW
// operators run 500 Hz or narrower - 200 Hz is not unusual - with the passband
// least usable at its edges, exactly where a QRP signal has least energy to
// spare. Around 100 Hz or less is what actually works; Roy uses +60 on his own
// rig. The slider stops at CW_TX_OFFSET_MAX_HZ (300) for that reason.
//
// The QMX has no XIT (its own CAT manual: "XIT status: always 0 because QMX has
// no XIT"), so this is done with SPLIT: receive on VFO A, transmit on VFO B,
// with B held at A + offset. FB/FR/FT/SP all exist in 1_03 as well as 1_04, so
// no firmware gate is needed.
//
// Maintained here, in the poll task, rather than bolted onto cat_set_frequency:
//   - the poll task owns the CDC pipe, and this needs two more writes;
//   - it therefore follows EVERY way the frequency can move - a tap on the
//     panadapter, a spot click, a memory recall, a band change, the web UI, and
//     the radio's own tuning knob - which is exactly Roy's "I can change
//     frequency to another station, and not touch anything else, and the offset
//     will follow".
//
// Rules that matter more than the mechanism:
//   - CW only. Any other mode stands it down: an offset transmit in SSB or a
//     digital mode would be a mistake, not a courtesy.
//   - We only ever clear split if WE set it. An operator running their own
//     split has not asked us to interfere with it.
//   - Re-asserted whenever the base frequency moves, and every 30 s regardless,
//     so a radio that dropped split on its own (band change, menu visit) is
//     brought back into line rather than transmitting on top of the DX.
//
// ⚠ We read `SP;` back but deliberately NEVER send `FB;`. The vendor CAT manual
// documents the FB *Get* as answering with an **FA**-prefixed string ("FB;"
// returns "FA00007016000;"). Whether that is a manual typo or the radio's real
// behaviour, querying it is a trap: our FA handler would take VFO B's value as
// the dial frequency, and since VFO B is computed FROM the dial, the offset
// would compound on every cycle and walk the radio up the band. One read-back

// whatever it happened to be when the link came up, for the rest of the session.
// Reported by Roy KI0ER (#165): the dial agreed with the radio but the waterfall
// did not, and tapping a CW signal tuned him ~30 Hz off, so he transmitted off
// frequency as if XIT were on. His errors were non-linear in the value he had
// asked for, which is what a stale CONSTANT looks like - not a scale error.
//
// Measured on the bench before writing this (QMX 1_04_004, Auto-offset/tone=YES,
// passband 300): setting CW centre to 650 dragged BOTH CW offset and Sidetone
// freq. to 650, and restoring 700 took all three back - so `CW offset` is the
// right item to read and it tracks the centre. Four consecutive reads returned
// the same value with the passband untouched, i.e. reading is stable and has no
// FW;-style re-assert side effect, which is what makes polling it safe at all.
//
// Returns true if it used the pipe this cycle.
/* Which CW filter widths the radio itself offers, as a bitmask over
 * CW_FILTER_WIDTHS. 0 means "not known, or the radio says none" - see below.

 * Uwe DL8UG: the Tab5 lists all eight widths in CW while his QMX has only a few
 * enabled, and he "keeps mis-tapping them with my fat fingers". He configures

 * connect.
 *
 * ⭐ VERIFIED ON HARDWARE 2026-09-07, including the case that matters. The rows
 * are a Mask menu (type 7, list type 6 = DISABLED/ENABLED) and are read one at a
 * time by INDEX:
 *
 *     MMCW|Choose filters|0;   ->   MMENABLED;  /  MMDISABLED;
 *
 * ⛔ By index and never by name: the row names ARE the numbers, so
 * "MMCW|Choose filters|50;" is parsed as a path index and returns ?; - the CAT
 * manual states this explicitly. Index order is 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 500,
 * confirmed by discovery (MMCW|Choose filters|N?; -> MM7|6|<width>;) and then by
 * disabling exactly 50 and 400 on the radio and reading back exactly those two.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ AND THE ALL-ZERO CASE IS REAL, NOT DEFENSIVE. On this bench, before the
 * menu had ever been opened, all eight read DISABLED while the radio was quite
 * happily running a 200 Hz filter - the mask appears not to be written until
 * something visits that menu. Hiding the disabled ones there would leave the
 * operator with NO CW bandwidth at all. So zero means "show everything", which
 * is also exactly right for older firmware, a radio that does not answer, and a
 * link that dies mid-read. */

     * Randy N4OPI, 2026-09-08: "I use the pull-down to change bands and the
     * pull down box changes, but the actual operating frequency doesn't" - with
     * a screenshot showing 7.074.000 Hz on the readout, "20 m 14.074" in the
     * dropdown, and a QSO in progress reading TX IN ~29s.
     *
     * That is the whole explanation. An FT8 burst owns the CDC link for its
     * ~12.7 s, sending 79 TA<freq>; commands on a 160 ms cadence, and
     * s_poll_paused exists to keep everything else off the pipe for exactly
     * that reason. This function never checked it, so a band change landed in
     * the middle of the tone sequence: the radio got a garble, answered ?;, and
     * the frequency write was simply lost. The UI had already moved
     * optimistically, so the two disagreed until the next poll.
     *
     * It is now DEFERRED rather than dropped, which is the pattern this file
     * already uses for mode (s_pending_mode_digit) and the SSB filter. The poll
     * task sends it the moment it owns the pipe again - a second or so later at
     * worst, and the operator's band change is not silently thrown away.
     *
     * ⚠ LAST ONE WINS on purpose: a single slot, not a queue. Someone spinning
     * a band dropdown during a burst means the last choice, not a stack of
     * retunes to replay afterwards. */
