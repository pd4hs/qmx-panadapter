 *
 * The QMX shows this on its OWN LCD in decibels - operation manual, "Volume
 * change" parameter: "the new volume is displayed momentarily on the bottom
 * left of the LCD. The volume is shown in decibels." So dB = value / 4, and
 * the drawer slider is in dB so the number on the Tab5 is the same number the
 * radio shows. Do not reintroduce a percentage here.
 *
 * Protocol range is 0-799 = 0-199.75 dB, matching the volume knob's own "0 to
 * 200dB gain" (operation manual, audio chain step 23).
 *
 * CAT_AF_GAIN_DB_MAX is the SLIDER's top, and it is deliberately below that
 * protocol maximum: a 0-199 dB slider put every setting an operator actually
 * wants inside the leftmost couple of centimetres.
 *
 * The number comes from Randy N4OPI, who has the only radio it has been measured
 * against, and it took two rounds to get right - keep both here, because the
 * first round is a lesson about acting on a range description:
 *   1. 2026-07-29, first report: "the usable portion is concentrated in the
 *      first 10% of the range - anything beyond that is way too loud". Read
 *      literally that is ~20 dB, so the cap went to 40.
 *   2. Same day, after using it: 40 dB "is not quite loud enough for weak
 *      signals down at the noise floor or in a noisy environment" on headphones
 *      or an added speaker. He suggested 70. So 70 it was, briefly.
 *   3. 2026-07-30: Randy retracted round 2 - he had been listening with the
 *      antenna switched OFF, so the "not loud enough" was the missing band
 *      noise, not a missing gain range. With the antenna on, "40 seems plenty
 *      loud now. Maybe 50?" - so 50, splitting his two with-antenna reports.
 * The lesson from round 1 stands: "too loud beyond X" described where the
 * COMFORTABLE listening range ended, not where the useful range did. Round 3
 * adds its own: ask what the antenna was doing before acting on a loudness
 * report. 50 dB gives ~10 px/dB on the drawer's 488 px slider. Do NOT turn
 * the scale back into a percentage (the whole point is that the number
 * matches the radio's own LCD).
 *
 * Deferred to the poll task like the filter writes - a direct cross-thread
 * write races the FA/MD/FW poll and the QMX returns ?;.

 *
 * Two things this is NOT:
 *  - not AF gain: AG is the volume in 0.25 dB steps, RG is plain dB. The
 *    commands look alike and are scaled differently.
 *  - not session-only: unlike Q9/Q3, the CAT manual does not mark RG as
 *    "current operating session only", and the same value is editable in the
 *    Band Configuration terminal app - so a write here changes the operator's
 *    stored per-band configuration. That is why the drawer commits on slider
 *    RELEASE rather than on every tick of a drag.
