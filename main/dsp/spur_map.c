     * John W5JSS, 2026-09-19, from his own diag log: a measurement started at

     * page, which pushed 14.095600 and the radio confirmed it; 0.4 s after
     * that THIS function wrote its nudge (14.074025) and then "restored"
     * 14.074000 straight over the top. His beacon then received - and would
     * have transmitted - on the FT8 frequency while every spot it filed said
     * 14.095600. He reported it as "not receiving spots and no one spotting
     * me", and nothing on screen could have told him why.
