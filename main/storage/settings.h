// Max. PA voltage settings, built against a dummy load by keying a real
// DiGi TA<freq>; tone - the same primitives a WSPR/FT8 burst is built from.
//
// This is a property of the RADIO'S HARDWARE, not an operator preference -
// deliberately NOT part of config export/import (a restored config on a
// different physical QMX would carry the wrong radio's numbers).
//
// 1.0-12.0 V, average 0.25 V steps: the QMX operation manual (op_104.txt,
// "Max. PA voltage") states a setting below ~1 V has no further effect -
// leakage from the 74ACT08 driver chip through to the LPF sets the real
// floor - so there is nothing to gain by sweeping lower. WSPR is commonly
// run at 10-27 dBm (10-500 mW), well below the ~1 W a plain 5-point sweep
// bottomed out at, hence the resolution: this range is where it actually
// matters.
//
// ⚠ "0.25 V steps" is an AVERAGE, not a literal step size - the CAT `MM`
// Set for this field is `%u.%u`, one decimal digit, so the radio itself
// only accepts 0.1 V granularity (1.25 V cannot be asked for; 1.2 or 1.3
// can). The table alternates +0.3/+0.2 V (see s_test_voltage_x10 in
// power_cal_modal.c) so every individual point is something the radio can
// actually be set to, while the sequence averages the finer resolution.
// Widened 0.5 -> ~0.25 V, 2026-09-15, for the 23 dBm (200 mW) - 27 dBm
// (500 mW) gap the operator found unexpectedly coarse (2.5 V vs 4.0 V, no
// calibrated point between them) - operator: "there seems to be a huge PA
// diff between 23 and 27 dBm ... maybe we need more steps in-between".
//
// ⛔ THIS DOES NOT HELP BELOW ~20 dBm (100 mW). The QMX's own `PC;` power
// readback only resolves to about 100 mW - the radio cannot itself tell
// 0 mW from 50 mW apart - so 0/3/7/10/13/17 dBm will always read `--`
// regardless of sweep density. That is an instrument floor of the
// measurement technique, not something more calibration points can fix;
// verifying anything below it needs a different measurement path (an
// external power meter or attenuator), which this feature does not have.
