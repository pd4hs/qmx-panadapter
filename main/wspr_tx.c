 * and unreachable. It is the wrong default the moment the page is in the swipe
 * cycle with a TX switch on it: the operator would arm TX, watch the burst run,
 * and never be spotted by anybody. A control that reports success and does
 * nothing is the worst outcome available.
 *
 * The on-air proof came from commit 3db70a8 ("ON THE AIR - 50 spots worldwide,
 * zero drift, all fields correct"), which was built with this flipped locally
 * while the committed source stayed at 0 - so the evidence and the default
 * disagreed for weeks without anyone noticing.
 *
 * What still stands between this and an unexpected transmission, all of which
 * predate this change: wspr_tx_en defaults OFF, the callsign and grid must be
 * set or the slot loop refuses, simulation mode interlocks every byte, and
 * tx_cmd_critical() retries the stop-transmit rather than leaving a radio
 * keyed. */
