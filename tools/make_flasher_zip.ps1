# Build the flasher archive that ships as a GitHub release asset.

# ⛔ EXPLICIT FILE LIST, NEVER A WILDCARD.
#
# v1.8.8 shipped a 44 MB asset because the zip was built with
#     Compress-Archive -Path "tools\QMX-Panadapter flasher\*"
# and that directory accumulates every historical flasher zip - 27 of them,
# 40 MB - so the release carried a decade of its own past. They are gitignored,
# so nothing in the repo or in `git status` hinted at it, and the only reason it
# was ever noticed is that a user said the download had got big (Gyula HA3HZ).
# Users were downloading 44 MB to receive 3.4 MB of firmware.
#
# A wildcard over a directory that accumulates build output will eventually
# sweep something up. This lists what belongs and fails on anything missing, so
# a too-SMALL archive is caught as loudly as a too-large one.
