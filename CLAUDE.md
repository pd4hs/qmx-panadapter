# CLAUDE.md — QMX Panadapter

ESP-IDF firmware for M5Stack Tab5 (ESP32-P4). Real-time panadapter for the QRP Labs QMX/QMX+ HF transceiver: USB host captures IQ audio (UAC) + CAT (CDC-ACM), FFT runs on-device, spectrum + waterfall rendered on the 5" touch display (landscape 1280×720).

## Build & flash

```powershell
idf.py build flash monitor          # standard IDF
qmx bfm                             # PowerShell helper (build + flash + monitor)
qmx fm                              # flash + monitor (skip rebuild)
qmx m                               # monitor only
```

Exit monitor: `Ctrl+T` then `Ctrl+X`.

### ⛔⛔ THE QMX NEVER SURVIVES A FLASH. NOT ONCE. STOP RE-DISCOVERING THIS.

**Every flash of a Tab5 with the radio attached wedges the QMX** (#74 — a flash
is a warm reset, which is the documented trigger). It needs a **manual power
cycle by the operator, every single time.** The operator's own words, said
repeatedly: *"qmx can NOT survive any flash"* and *"it will never survive on
its own"*.

⛔ **NEVER report that the radio survived.** On 2026-08-24 I told him it had,
on the strength of `audio: RX 48561 pairs/s` and a live `qmx_fw` about 40 s
after boot — and offered it as "the first counter-example" to his own account
of his own bench. What had actually happened, almost certainly, is that he was
sitting at the shack and power-cycled it himself. **I credited the firmware for
his hand, and argued with him about his own hardware.**

**Why that evidence is worthless, and this file already said so:** the identical
mistake is recorded under the `MU;` note — *"that figure proves the stream is
flowing and says nothing about its content"*. A pairs/s reading cannot
distinguish "re-enumerated on its own" from "the operator reached over and
switched it off and on". Neither can `/api/status`, since it reports whatever
the link currently is, not how it got there.

**So the standing behaviour is:**
1. Before flashing with the radio attached, say plainly that the QMX will need
   a power cycle afterwards.
2. After flashing, **ask** whether he has power-cycled it — never infer it.
3. If audio is flowing, that means *someone* fixed it. Assume it was him.
4. A survival claim would need the port watched across the whole reset with
   nobody touching the radio. Absent that, there is no counter-example.

⚠ **This lived only in a memory file until now, which is exactly why it kept
happening** — memory is consulted when something feels relevant, and a routine
flash never does. Same reasoning as the serial-capture rules below. It belongs
here, in the file that is read in full every session.


### ⛔ FOUR boards share this machine — resolve every port by BENCH NAME

`docs/bench-setup.md` is the standing reference and `tools/bench.json` is the
registry the tooling reads. Read the doc before touching hardware; the short
version:

| Bench | Board | Radio | Console | Tree |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **dev** | Tab5 #1 `30:ED:A0:EA:DD:57` | QMX | COM3 → COM20 | `qmx-panadapter` / `main` |
| **lab** | Tab5 #3 | QMX+ | COM21 | `-wspr` / `-cw` |
| **field** | Tab5 #2 `80:F1:B2:D1:45:92` | none | COM22 | last **release**, **OTA only — never USB-flash it** |
| **port** | Waveshare P4 7B | none | COM12 → COM23 | `-p4` / `feat/board-hal-seam` |

- **All four enumerate as `VID_303A&PID_1001` with no serial number**, so the COM
  number follows the SOCKET, not the board. `idf.py flash` with no `-p` has
  already partially flashed a Tab5 binary onto the Waveshare and boot-looped it.
  Use `bench flash <name>`, which resolves the port from the registry and then
  **verifies the `serial(MAC)=` line in the boot header afterwards**.
- **The lock is about the PORT and the BUILD DIR now, not the CPU.** This rule
  used to read "ONE build at a time, all four trees ... the CPU is 2 cores, so a
  second build starves both" — that described the **old i7-7600U laptop**.
  Measured 2026-09-09: this machine is an **AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, 8 physical / 16
  logical cores, 61 GB RAM @ 3200 MT/s**. So the CPU justification is gone, and
  that line has now been wrong twice (its previous explanation, "the pinned IDF
  Python environment isn't concurrency-safe", is also marked wrong in the same
  sentence). ⚠ I have NOT timed two concurrent builds, so this is not a claim
  that they are free — two `idf.py build`s put ~32 ninja jobs on 16 threads, so
  expect each to slow; it is a claim that neither starves.
  **What the lock is still genuinely for:** two builds in the SAME build dir
  would have ninja and CMake fighting over the same outputs, which is corruption
  rather than slowness; and flashing wants serialising because `bench flash`
  stops and restarts the capture, and two of those interleaving is exactly how
  COM9 ended up held during a flash on 2026-09-09.
  `bench build`/`bench flash` take `C:/dev/bench.lock`.
- **ONE antenna, two radios, a switch.** Decode counts, SNR and noise floor from
  the bench that does NOT hold the antenna are meaningless. `bench antenna
  <name>` records the holder; ask before believing any receive measurement.
- **Standing patches split two ways**: six edit the shared IDF tree
  (`C:/esp/v5.4.4`, applied once per machine — one IDF reinstall breaks all four
  benches), three edit `managed_components/` (per tree, wiped by `fullclean` — so
  four applications, one per tree). Table in the doc.

### ⛔ Serial capture: the rules, because getting these wrong has cost DAYS

Every one of these is a mistake I actually made, each of which produced a
CONFIDENT WRONG CONCLUSION reported to the operator as fact. They are here, in
the file that is read in full every session, because they were in memory
instead and memory is only consulted when something feels relevant — which is
exactly what a routine step never does. **Read this list before touching a
capture, not after a result looks strange.**

1. **A capture that reset the device is how the "mystery double boot" was
   born.** `cap_serial_boot.ps1` and `-Reset` pulse RTS on open. Starting one
   as a passive monitor REBOOTS THE TAB5. The operator spent an hour reporting
   a boot→dark→boot cycle that was my monitor, on top of the flash's own reset.
   Use `tools/cap_serial_reboot.ps1` with NO `-Reset` for anything
   standing (or just `bench capture <name>`, which gets the flags right).
   ⚠ **These three scripts moved from `scratchpad/` to `tools/` on 2026-08-23**
   because `scratchpad/` is gitignored — the most load-bearing diagnostic tool
   in the project was untracked, existed on exactly one disk, and would have
   been lost by a clone onto a new machine. Only pass `-Reset` when the boot itself is the thing under study.
   ⛔ **AND "NO `-Reset`" IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF PASSIVITY. Opening the port
   can reset the Tab5 anyway.** Caught 2026-08-27: a standing capture was
   restarted with no `-Reset` and the device came up with
   `rst:0x17 (CHIP_USB_UART_RESET)` - the USB-serial peripheral resetting the
   chip, not a crash, and no panic record. The script never touches DTR/RTS
   without the switch; .NET's `SerialPort.Open()` evidently drives the lines
   enough for the P4's auto-reset circuit. **It is NOT deterministic** - an
   identical restart four hours earlier on the same day left a 41-minute
   uptime untouched, so it cannot be predicted either way.
   The cost is never just the reboot: a warm reset with the radio attached is
   the documented **#74** trigger, so that restart wedged the QMX and threw
   away 4 h 17 m of accumulated in-RAM WSPR spots. **Treat restarting a
   capture as an action that may reboot the device and wedge the radio.** Do
   it when the operator can reach the power switch, not while they are out,
   and never mid-run on a device that is accumulating something.
2. **NEVER put `Stop-Process` in the same PowerShell call as the capture.** It
   exits non-zero, PowerShell aborts the rest of the chain, the capture never
   starts, and a zero-byte file gets read as "no crash in the log". This single
   bug is the whole history of "the background shell didn't run". Kill in one
   call, start in another.
3. **Two captures cannot share COM3.** Kill the old one first or the new one
   logs `PORT LOST` and records nothing.
4. **VERIFY BYTES BEFORE INTERPRETING.** `stat -c%s` / `.Length` must be > 0.
   An empty log is not evidence of a quiet device. This one rule would have
   caught every failure above.
5. **Count boots ONLY with `grep -c "Loaded app from partition"`.** A regex over
   numbers in parentheses matches image-segment sizes like `( 22520)` and
   invents reboots that never happened (done twice in one session).
6. **A capture without reconnect CANNOT see a reboot.** The console is
   USB-Serial/JTAG implemented BY the P4, so a reset drops the USB device and
   the handle dies — the file just stops, looking healthy. Only
   `cap_serial_reboot.ps1` reopens.
7. **A post-flash first boot is a different event from an RTS reset.** To catch
   it: `python -m esptool --port COM3 --after no_reset write_flash
   "@flash_project_args"` (from `build/`), then start the capture with `-Reset`.
8. **The monitor ALWAYS misses the boot after `idf.py flash`.** For boot lines
   use `/api/log` (live ring) or `/api/log/saved` (flash-persisted) instead.
9. **`GET /api/log` DELETES the ring it just served.** `log_handler` calls
   `diag_log_clear()` after a successful send, so each download is "since the
   last one". Polling it in a loop to watch for something therefore **erases the
   evidence continuously** — every fetch returns a few seconds of delta, and a
   feature that logged something 20 s ago looks like a feature that never ran.
   Cost most of a Fox/Hound test cycle on 2026-08-10, and produced two confident
   wrong conclusions ("the tick never fires", "the Fox is never injected") from a
   log I had shredded myself. **To WATCH the device, use a serial capture**
   (`cap_serial_reboot.ps1`, no `-Reset`) — non-destructive, survives reboots,
   and it is what these rules already told me to do. `/api/log` is for taking ONE
   snapshot to keep; `/api/log/saved` (flash) is read-only and safe but lags
   ~30 s.
10. **A capture that has EXPIRED looks exactly like a quiet, healthy device.**
   `cap_serial_reboot.ps1` runs for `-Seconds` (default 300) and then exits,
   writing a tidy `=== [capture] done ===` at the end. Grep that file an hour
   later and you get "0 reboots, 0 panics" — for a window that closed long ago.
   Caught 2026-08-09 when the operator asked whether the monitor was still up
   and it had been dead for 50 minutes. **Before reporting anything from a
   capture, check the process is alive AND that the file's `LastWriteTime` is
   within the last few seconds.** Note the parameter is `-Seconds`, not
   `-Minutes`; pass something long for a standing monitor.
   ⛔ **Re-check DURING a long session, not only at the start.** A CONCURRENT
   SESSION taking COM3 produces this exact state with the victim process still
   running and reporting nothing wrong — 2026-08-24, a capture went deaf at
   18:20 and read like a quiet, healthy device for two hours while the Tab5 was
   fine. The PORT dies, not the process, so the file's timestamp is the only
   honest liveness test. Running several sessions at once is the operator's
   normal daily practice, so treat this as expected, not exotic.
   ⛔ **CORRECTION 2026-09-18: `LastWriteTime` is NOT "the only honest
   liveness test" — it LAGS, in both directions, and both errors were seen in
   one session.** Windows does not update an open file's directory entry on
   every buffered write, so a capture that is genuinely writing can read
   minutes stale (measured: metadata said 228 s while `Get-Content -Tail`
   returned lines newer than the previous read), and a capture that has just
   died can read 1 s old. **The honest test is CONTENT: read the last line,
   wait ~20 s, read it again.** Timestamp-stale plus content-advancing means
   healthy; content frozen means dead, whatever the clock says. The watchdog
   still uses the timestamp, which is the right trade for an unattended
   one-minute cycle (it errs toward a restart), but do NOT report liveness to
   the operator from metadata.
   ⛔ **AND `bench.standdown.<name>` MAKES A DEAD CAPTURE PERMANENT AND
   SILENT.** 2026-09-18: the dev capture died at 01:18:38 and the flag was
   written at 01:18:41 by a concurrent session, so the watchdog skipped that
   bench by design — four cycles, no restart, nothing in
   `bench-watchdog.log` (it only logs when it ACTS, so silence is not evidence
   of health). **When a capture is dead and the watchdog is not fixing it,
   check for the standdown flag BEFORE debugging the watchdog.** `bench
   capture <name>` clears it.
11. ⛔ **A CAPTURE I START FROM A TOOL CALL GETS KILLED — use `bench capture`,
   which registers a SCHEDULED TASK.** Three deaths on the night of 2026-09-11,
   across two ports and two trees, after 20 s, 9 min and 1 min: every one with
   **no `=== [capture] done ===` and no `PORT LOST`**, i.e. terminated rather
   than exited. `Start-Process` did not survive, and neither did
   `Invoke-CimMethod Win32_Process Create`, which was tried precisely to escape
   the job object. One of them (COM9, 22:47:13) died five seconds before Windows
   logged `Application Hang: powershell.exe ... was closed`, in the same minute
   the Claude desktop app disabled its own service, redeployed itself via AppX
   and restarted — so a capture dies with the app that transitively owns it, and
   an app update in the night is enough to end it.
   ⚠ **The overnight soak of 2026-09-11 was lost this way** and had to be
   reconstructed from the SD diag log plus `/api/log/saved`. Rule 10 is what
   makes it expensive: a dead capture reads as a quiet, healthy device, so the
   night reports "no crashes" for a window that shut minutes after it opened.
   `Cmd-Capture` in `tools/bench.ps1` now does `schtasks /create` + `/run`, which
   the task scheduler owns. Two things it got wrong first, both worth keeping:
   **`/rl highest` and `/ru` need elevation** and answered `Access is denied` from
   an ordinary shell (the capture only opens a COM port and has never needed
   admin), and under that script's `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` a native exe
   writing to stderr **aborts the script** — so `schtasks /end` on a task that
   does not exist yet, the normal first-run case, killed the function. Every
   schtasks call goes through `Invoke-Task-Quiet`, i.e. `cmd /c ... >nul 2>&1`.
   ⚠ **And it must run through `tools/run_hidden.vbs`, or it leaves a console
   window on the operator's desktop** — a task running as the logged-on user runs
   INTERACTIVELY, and an interactive console program always gets a window.
   `-WindowStyle Hidden` only **minimises** it. ⭐ **The lesson is the
   instrument, not the flag:** I checked `powershell.exe`'s `MainWindowHandle`,
   got 0, and reported it hidden — but the window belongs to **conhost.exe**, so
   that test could never have seen it, and the operator had to tell me twice.
   Enumerate **every** process with a non-zero `MainWindowHandle` instead; a
   minimised window still has one. `WScript.Shell.Run(cmd, 0, False)` creates no
   window at all and needs no elevation, which `schtasks /ru <user> /np` (session
   0, no desktop) would have.
12. ⛔ **`bench flash` SILENTLY SKIPPED STOPPING THE CAPTURE, AND THE CAUSE IS A
   POWERSHELL TYPE TRAP WORTH KNOWING BY NAME.** Three flashes failed in a row on
   2026-09-12 with `Could not open COM5, the port is busy ... Access is denied`.
   Nothing was written any of those times — the good outcome — but this is the
   same shape as COM9 being held through a flash on 2026-09-09.

   `Get-CaptureProcess` built `$procs = @()` and returned it. **PowerShell
   unrolls a one-element array on return**, so with exactly ONE capture running
   the caller got a bare `CimInstance`. Then:
   ```powershell
   $hadCapture = ((Get-CaptureProcess $b.capture).Count -gt 0)   # $null -gt 0 = FALSE
   ```
   so `Cmd-StopCapture` was never called at all. `bench stopcapture` worked
   throughout, because its own guard is `-eq 0` and `$null -eq 0` is *also*
   false, so it fell through to the kill loop. One helper, two callers, opposite
   outcomes from the same null.

   ⭐ **The trap is that this is TYPE-DEPENDENT.** PS 3.0+ adds an ETS `Count` to
   most scalars, so `(Get-Process ...).Count` really is 1 — but a `CimInstance`
   does **not** get it and yields `$null`. Measured:
   | scalar | `.Count` | `-gt 0` |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Process` | 1 | True |
   | `CimInstance` | *(empty)* | **False** |

   ⚠ **I tested it with the wrong type and retracted a CORRECT diagnosis**,
   telling the operator the root cause was wrong when it was right. Testing an
   *analogue* of the object instead of the object is how that happened. Fixed
   with `return ,$procs` (the comma survives unrolling) plus `@()` at every call
   site, and `Wait-PortFree` now *tests* the port instead of sleeping 1 s.

   **Generalise: never call `.Count` on an unwrapped function return in
   PowerShell — write `@(f ...).Count`.**
   ⛔ **And the `return ,$procs` half of that fix was WRONG (measured
   2026-09-13):** together with `@()` at the call site it nests the result, so
   `@(f).Count` is **1 for an EMPTY list** and every element is an inner array.
   It hid because `$nested.ProcessId` enumerates the real PID when the list is
   non-empty. Zero captures read as one with a null PID and broke the first
   flash after `bench standdown`. Use a plain `return $procs` plus `@()` at the
   call site — never both the comma and the `@()`. A blank where a number should be in a
   log line (`Stopped  capture process(es)`) is the tell.
13. ⛔ **A CAPTURE PROCESS CAN STAY ALIVE AND STOP WRITING FOREVER, AND
   `bench capture`'S OWN "ALREADY RUNNING" GUARD THEN PROTECTS THE CORPSE.**
   `bench_watchdog.ps1` (rule 11) restarted nothing for 6.5 straight hours on
   2026-09-12 — every one-minute cycle logged `restart produced NO output`
   within 8–9 seconds, far too fast for the 20–40 s retry loop `Cmd-Capture`
   runs when it genuinely tries to start something. That timing is the tell:
   `Cmd-Capture` was hitting its own **"already running — leave it alone"**
   early return every single time, because a process genuinely WAS still
   alive — just stuck, holding the port, writing nothing.

   Likely mechanism (matches the timeline: failures continued for hours after
   the device itself had recovered from a flash+reboot): `SerialPort.Open()`/
   `Read()` against a COM port backed by a USB-CDC device that has since reset
   can **block indefinitely** on the OS side rather than throwing — so the
   capture script's own try/catch/reconnect logic never gets a turn, because
   the thread never returns from the blocking call. `schtasks /end` cannot
   reach it either: the task only ever launched `wscript.exe`, which already
   exited the instant it detached the real capture process (that is the whole
   point of `run_hidden.vbs`) — the capture is an orphan from Task Scheduler's
   point of view from the moment it starts.

   So "is a process already running" is the right question for a HUMAN typing
   `bench capture` (never clobber a healthy one), and the wrong question for a
   WATCHDOG, whose entire job is to find a process that is alive but not doing
   its job. Fixed: the watchdog now treats **file staleness** as ground truth,
   independent of what `Get-CaptureProcess` says — on a stale file it kills
   whatever holds the port first, then calls `bench capture -Force`, every
   time. `bench.ps1` itself is unchanged; only the watchdog's judgement of when
   a restart is warranted changed.

14. ⛔ **"RELEASE COM5 AND STAND DOWN" MEANS `bench standdown dev`.** Killing a
   capture by hand is not enough: the watchdog respawns it within a minute, so
   a new session could never get the port back. `standdown` sets
   `C:/dev/bench.standdown.<name>` (the watchdog skips that bench), kills every
   capture for that file OR port and confirms they died, removes leftover
   `tail -f` viewers, and only says done once the port actually opens.
   `bench capture <name>` clears the flag. Also since 2026-09-13: `bench
   capture` replaces a capture that exists but has a STALE file instead of
   answering "already running" - that answer left the post-flash boot
   uncaptured the same day.

**And the standing one: NEVER GUESS.** When a symptom appears, get the
measurement first. Every "obvious cause" in this file has been wrong when
measured — WiFi death was not memory (99 KB free), the BLE 30 s drop was not
Protocol Mode (it made it worse), the cursor was not off-screen (I misread a
pre-rotation coordinate). If a fix is a hypothesis, say so in those words.

**Claude Code note**: each PowerShell tool call is a fresh non-interactive shell — the user's `$PROFILE` (which defines `qmx`/`idfenv`) is not loaded, and `idf.py` fails with "IDF_PATH environment variable needs to be set". Activate the IDF environment in the same command chain first:
```powershell
& "C:\esp\v5.4.4\esp-idf\export.ps1" | Out-Null; idf.py build
```

**Build/flash/monitor — just do it**: after making code changes, build and flash (and monitor if useful) without asking for permission first, unless the user has explicitly said not to. Don't ask "want me to flash now?" — just run it.

**Pinned to ESP-IDF v5.4.4.** Do not upgrade — ESP32-P4 v1.3 (ECO2) silicon requires `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_0=y` and CPU capped at 360 MHz, both baked into `sdkconfig`.

                          frequency so a revisit needs NO nudge. Baseband DC is qualified a
                          priori - bin 0 cannot move when the LO does, so the motion test

  cw_decode.c             Decoded CW from the QMX's OWN decoder, read over CAT (TB;). The Tab5
                          does NO decoding - that is the whole reason it is affordable when
                          core 0 is the wall. ⭐ TB is in the 1_03 CAT manual as well as 1_04,
                          so NO cat_qmx_fw_at_least() gate. ⛔ The radio's buffer is 40 chars
                          and is NOT circular ("simply discards any new incoming characters"),
                          so TB; must be polled on a steady cadence - at 20 WPM it fills in
                          ~24 s and what is lost is lost silently. Holds the ONE wrap-around

## Critical quirks

### PI4IO expander must be initialized before display bring-up
`display_init` calls `bsp_i2c_init()` + `bsp_io_expander_pi4ioe_init()` first, then waits 120 ms. Skipping this causes a cold-boot hang in the DSI FIFO loop. Soft resets mask the bug because the expander retains state across ESP32 resets.

### Patched components in `components/`
`components/espressif__usb_host_uac/` is a hand-patched fork with `create_background_task = true`. Required for UAC + CDC-ACM to coexist on the same USB host. Do not replace with the registry version without re-applying the patches (4 as of 2026-08-03: background task; ringbuf-overflow WARN+count; 1 Hz `RX xport` ISO stats; **forced teardown on a dead device** — EP-halt/interface-release failures during suspend/close are logged and ignored so `uac_host_device_close()` always frees the usb_host device; without it a QMX powered off mid-stream left a permanent "zombie" device occupying the root port until reboot, TODO #75).

`components/espressif__esp_lcd_touch_st7123/` is a hand-patched fork fixing ST7121 compatibility (see **ST7121 has an incomplete register map** below). Do not replace with the registry version.

### mDNS: the device answers to `qmx.local`
`net/mdns_svc.c` starts an mDNS responder from wifi.c's got-IP path (idempotent — that path also runs on every reconnect and roam) and advertises `_http._tcp` on port 80. Hostname is a fixed `MDNS_SVC_HOSTNAME` ("qmx"), deliberately not a setting: it is the one thing an operator has to remember about the web UI, and something you must look up is barely better than an IP. Two units on one LAN would collide — make it a setting then, defaulting to this.

**Why it earns its place on a device this memory-tight:** the WiFi layer picks its own network (up to six remembered, roams to whichever is on the air), so the IP changes without anyone deciding it should — and the only place it is shown is the Tab5's own bottom bar, which is useless when the Tab5 is in the shack and you are not. Failure is soft everywhere: `mdns_init()` or the service advert failing logs a warning and leaves the IP working.

**It costs internal RAM, and the fix was NOT the obvious one.** Stock, mDNS took the internal low-water mark from **~31 KB to ~9 KB** — on this board that is the difference between "fine" and "the next runtime allocation is a coin toss" (see the `MALLOC_CAP_DMA` and `.bss` notes). Measured, three builds, same session and same network:

| Build | internal low-water mark |
|---|---|
| before mDNS | 27–31 KB |
| mDNS defaults (internal task, `MAX_INTERFACES=3`, `MAX_SERVICES=10`) | 8–12 KB |
| + `MDNS_TASK_CREATE_FROM_SPIRAM` + `MDNS_MEMORY_ALLOC_SPIRAM` | 9–10 KB — **no measurable change** |
| + `MDNS_MAX_INTERFACES=1`, `MDNS_MAX_SERVICES=2` | **22 KB** |

So the cost was the **static tables**, not the task stack — the component sizes for 3 interfaces and 10 services by default, and we have exactly one of each (WiFi STA, `_http._tcp`). The PSRAM settings are kept because they match this project's standing rule for background tasks (`util/psram_task.h`), **not** because they were shown to help; do not cite them as the fix. All four settings live in `sdkconfig` AND `sdkconfig.defaults`, since a `fullclean` regenerates the former.

**Generalise this:** a managed component's defaults are sized for a generic device with several interfaces. On this board, check its Kconfig for interface/service/buffer counts and cut them to what we actually have BEFORE assuming a memory cost is intrinsic — and measure, because the obvious culprit (a task stack) was not the one that mattered here.

⚠ **Adding `espressif/mdns` to `main/idf_component.yml` re-resolves `managed_components/`** — which is where the two hand-applied `esp_hosted` patches live. They survived this particular refresh (verified: both scripts reported "already patched"), but *any* dependency change is a moment to re-run `apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1` and `apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1` before building.

### esp_hosted transport buffers → PSRAM (managed-component patch — must be re-applied)
`managed_components/espressif__esp_hosted/host/port/include/os_wrapper.h` has a one-line patch in its `MEM_ALLOC` macro: `extra_heap_caps = MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` (was `0`). This routes the esp_hosted WiFi transport DMA pool (the per-packet TX/RX buffers that grow under WiFi bursts) into PSRAM instead of the scarce internal DRAM. **Without it the device reboots** under QMX+FT8 load when WiFi TX bursts (web UI / QRZ upload) exhaust internal DMA RAM → `transport_drv_sta_tx` → `assert(copy_buff)`. Safe on ESP32-P4: `SOC_SDMMC_PSRAM_DMA_CAPABLE == 1`, and the 1536-byte block is 64-byte aligned. `managed_components/` is **git-ignored** and is wiped by `idf.py fullclean` / a dependency refresh / the release process's `rm -r managed_components/`, so after any of those re-run `tools/patches/apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1` (idempotent) before building. This is half of the upload/web-stability fix; the rest is in-repo: audio ring → PSRAM, `dsp_set_transfer_quiet()` (CPU-yield during transfers), and the WS-stream pause.

### Diagnostic log persistence (RAM ring → flash → SD)
The always-on diag log lives in a 5 MB PSRAM ring (`util/diag_log.c`) — wiped on power-off. Two persistence layers survive a reboot/battery-pull:
- **Internal flash (always, no card needed)**: `diag_log_persist_start()` (called from `app_main` after `adif_log_init` mounts SPIFFS) runs a task appending the ring to `/spiffs/diag.log` (256 KB rolling, one rotation to `diag.0.log`), flushed+`fsync`'d every 30 s only when there are new bytes (low wear; SPIFFS is 1 MB, shared with the ADIF log). This is the POTA path: log in the field, download at home after power-off. Served at **`/api/log/saved`**. The live full-session ring is at `/api/log`. Both are fetched by the SINGLE web-UI item **Files -> "Diagnostic download ↓"** (`diag-both-link`), which triggers two staggered downloads, `qmx-log.txt` + `qmx-log-saved.txt` — it replaced the old separate "Diag ↓" / "Diag(saved) ↓" buttons, so ask users for "Diagnostic download", not those names.
- **microSD (full 5 MB+, when a card is in)**: see below.
Both the SD and flash mirrors read the ring incrementally via `diag_log_total()`/`diag_log_read_from()` (separate monotonic cursors in `s_total` space; the `head == total % cap` invariant lets a total-position map straight to a ring index). **`fsync` is mandatory after writing an open log file** — `fflush` alone leaves the bytes in FatFs/SPIFFS buffers, so the file reads empty if the card is pulled / power cut before an `f_sync`/`f_close` (this bit the SD `qmx-log.txt`, which is held open and only appended).

⚠ **The flash copy is an ~11-MINUTE window, not a session record — and it ENOSPC'd with 400 KB free (2026-08-18, #191).** Measured on the operator's unit: the log grows **~47 KB/min** in an FT8 session (dominated by legitimate per-decode `ft8_test`/`ft8_screen` lines — CLAUDE.md's older "~0 lines/s at the deduplicated steady state" describes the CAT poll only, not FT8), so `diag.log` reaches its 256 KB cap and **rotates about every 11 minutes**. That is the real retention figure; for anything longer, the **serial capture** is the record, not `/api/log/saved`.

The ENOSPC was **not** a capacity problem — SPIFFS reported 536 KB used of 934 KB and `qso.adi` was 6 KB (37 QSOs). Deleting a 256 KB file every 11 minutes leaves many blocks holding a mix of live and deleted pages, and SPIFFS returns `ENOSPC` the moment GC cannot free a whole block within `CONFIG_SPIFFS_GC_MAX_RUNS`. **So on this filesystem "free space" does not mean "writable".** It self-heals (`diag_log.c` rotates early on `ENOSPC`) but only by **discarding a generation**, so the flash log silently loses the history it exists to preserve. Fixes: **GC budget 10 → 32** (`sdkconfig` *and* `sdkconfig.defaults`; safe here specifically because `SPI_FLASH_ERASE_YIELD_DURATION_MS=20` + `SPIRAM_XIP_FROM_PSRAM` mean GC cannot hold cache down long enough to trip the cyan flash, and the writes are on a priority-2 task), and the **reader page/TOC cache writes are deleted** — dead since 2026-08-06, up to ~30 KB per page view that nothing read back, plus a one-time reclaim at boot (`reader_net_purge_legacy_caches()`).

**The boot log now LISTS every `/spiffs` file with its size** (`adif_log.c`), because "536 KB used" was not actionable: answering *which file* previously needed a rebuilt firmware, and this partition holds the QSO log, the LoTW certificate **and private key**, and the diag log. The structural fix — the diag log deserves its own partition — is **#192, and it is DECIDED AGAINST**: the free tail above `ota_1` is firmware headroom, not log storage. Operator, 2026-09-18: *"my first priority is kept - fw expendabilities and stack maintenance comes first"*. The diag log has a working answer today in a microSD card; the app slot did not, at **47 KB free of 4 MB**. ⚠ **v1.15.0 SPENT THAT HEADROOM** — dropping the third app slot took the smallest slot to 6.81 MB with ~2.7 MB free, and `ota_1` now runs to the end of the 16 MB flash, so there is no free tail left to argue about. The decision stands for a different reason now: there is nothing to give. Growing a slot again would have to move `user_nvs` or `storage`, which is the one thing the partition file exists to prevent.

### microSD auto-archive + exFAT (IDF-tree patch — must be re-applied)
`storage/sd_archive.c` mirrors the always-on diag log (`qmx-log.txt`, rotated at 5 MB), the ADIF log (`qso.adi`), and the config export (`qmx-config.txt`) to `/sdcard/qmx-panadapter/` whenever a FAT/exFAT card is present (it probes for a mount on a background task — the Tab5 routes **no card-detect line** to the SoC, so presence is found by retrying `bsp_sdcard_init`, and removal by a write failure). The bottom-bar **"SD"** dot lights up green (static, not animated) while a card is mounted (`ui_set_sd_active()`) — deliberately not the breathing/pulsing style used for things needing attention elsewhere in the UI, since "a card is in the slot" is an ambient, usually-permanent state, not something to draw the eye to.

**SD-card screenshot save REMOVED (v0.19.2) — do not re-add without fixing the underlying SDMMC conflict.** A `POST /api/sd/shot` endpoint + "SD Shot" web UI button used to save a BMP to `/sdcard/qmx-panadapter/screenshots/`. Removed after it reproducibly killed WiFi: the microSD card uses `SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_0` (`bsp_sdcard_init` in `components/m5stack_tab5/m5stack_tab5.c`) and ESP-Hosted's WiFi link to the C6 co-processor uses `SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_1` (`H_SDMMC_HOST_SLOT` in `managed_components/espressif__esp_hosted/host/api/include/esp_hosted_config.h`) — but both slots share **one physical SDMMC host peripheral** (one clock generator, one DMA engine) on the ESP32-P4. `esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount()` re-touches that shared host's init/clock state for slot 0 while ESP-Hosted's slot-1 session is live, and a serial capture caught the exact failure: `H_SDIO_DRV: sdio_get_len_from_slave: Len from slave[2762] exceeds max [1536]` (a corrupted SDIO length field) immediately followed by every `RPC_ID__Req_WifiStaGetApInfo` (`0x126`) call timing out forever — the RSSI/SSID poll in `status_task()` (`util/status.c`, runs every 1 s) just spins on a dead link, and the device looks like "WiFi died" with no crash and no recovery. The web UI's own `/ss.bmp`-based screenshot ("Tab5Shot", served straight over the existing WiFi connection, no SD card involved) is unaffected and was kept. If SD-to-screenshot is ever wanted again, it needs the SD mount/write path to coordinate with (quiesce) ESP-Hosted's slot-1 session first — don't just re-add the old code.

**Correction, same release: the background SD mirror DOES trigger this too — found and fixed.** The note above originally claimed the always-on background mirror (log/ADIF/config) "appears not to trigger this." Wrong: `settings_flush()` called `sd_archive_mark_config_dirty()` on *every* successful NVS flush, including the routine `last_unix_time` write that the continuous FT8-derived time-sync correction triggers every ~15 s (once per FT8/FT4 slot) — `last_unix_time` isn't even part of `config_io_export()`'s output, so this re-wrote an identical `qmx-config.txt` to the SD card every single FT8 slot, for the entire time FT8 ran with a card mounted. This is the same SDMMC hazard as above, just firing continuously and automatically instead of on a rare user action — and far more dangerous because of it. Fixed in `settings.c` via `DIRTY_CONFIG_EXPORT_MASK` (lists exactly the dirty bits that correspond to fields the export actually contains; the SD-mirror trigger only fires if the flush intersects that mask). Verified via serial capture: before the fix, `sd_arch: mirrored` fired every ~15 s indefinitely, with recurring `rpc_core` RPC timeouts to the WiFi co-processor interleaved throughout a session; after the fix, 10+ minutes and 35 routine time-sync flushes produced zero SD mirrors and zero RPC timeouts. If any *other* dirty-settings code path is added later that should reach the SD mirror, make sure it's reflected in `config_io_export()` first, then add its `DIRTY_*` bit to the mask — don't bypass the mask.

**Third occurrence, 2026-06-30: a legitimate SD mirror colliding with a QRZ upload, not a spurious one.** The `DIRTY_CONFIG_EXPORT_MASK` fix above closed the *spurious, every-15s* re-mirror, but it never addressed the underlying hazard for a *genuine* mirror — the diag log mirrors every `WORK_MS` (3 s) unconditionally, and a real QSO completing also legitimately marks the ADIF mirror dirty (`adif_log.c` → `sd_archive_mark_adif_dirty()`, ungated by any mask). Field report + live serial capture (operator's own bench unit, SD card inserted): uploading a freshly-logged QSO to QRZ killed WiFi with the exact same `rpc_core: Timeout waiting for Resp for Req[0x126]` permanent-timeout signature, FT8/CAT otherwise unaffected. Root cause: `upload_task()` (`net/webserver.c`) already knew the QRZ/eQSL HTTPS upload needs the SDIO link to itself — it calls `dsp_set_transfer_quiet(true)` and `webserver_ws_set_paused(true)` for the upload's duration — but that code predates the v0.19.2 SD auto-archive feature and never took `sd_archive_lock()` (the mutex `sd_archive.c`'s own task already serializes its FatFs bursts against — used elsewhere for SD-log-download streaming, just not here), so the archive task's periodic SD writes could still land mid-upload and hit the same physical-SDMMC-host conflict. Fixed: `upload_task()` now also holds `sd_archive_lock(5000)` for the whole quiet window (best-effort — the upload still proceeds if the lock can't be acquired, rather than blocking a QRZ/eQSL upload indefinitely on a wedged SD task). No auto-recovery exists once the RPC link wedges — a Tab5 reboot is the only fix in the field if this is hit on an unpatched build.

**MAJOR MITIGATION (NOT a cure), 2026-07-06: the SD card now runs in SPI mode, not 4-bit SDMMC.** ⚠️ An earlier version of this note claimed this was a verified ROOT-CAUSE FIX that "eliminates" the wedge. **That was wrong — proven on hardware the same night: with the SPI build, card mounted+mirroring, WiFi still wedged with the exact `H_SDIO_DRV: sdio_get_len_from_slave ... exceeds max [1536]` + permanent `rpc_core 0x126` signature after ~15 minutes.** So SPI mode is a big *improvement*, not a cure — do not trust it as "solved."

What SPI mode actually bought (real, keep it): time-to-wedge went from **~1 min (4-bit SDMMC) to ~15 min (SPI)** — a ~15× improvement — and the mount cost dropped from **~122 KB internal RAM to ~900 B**. Both genuine wins. Mechanics: `bsp_sdcard_init()`/`_deinit()` (`components/m5stack_tab5/m5stack_tab5.c`) use `esp_vfs_fat_sdspi_mount()` on **`SPI2_HOST`** (`SDSPI_HOST_DEFAULT()` + `spi_bus_initialize()`), a separate controller from the SDMMC/SDIO block; pins reused (CLK=43, MOSI=44/was CMD, MISO=39/was D0, CS=42/was D3; D1/D2 unused). Throughput ~20 MHz vs 40 MHz — irrelevant for the small background mirror writes. **Do not "optimize" this back to `esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount()`/`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_0`.**

**Mechanism of the RESIDUAL wedge is NOT established — do not repeat my mistakes.** During this session I twice jumped to a confident cause and both were wrong: first "SPI mode cures it" (falsified by the 15-min recurrence), then "internal-DRAM starvation causes the residual" — also **rejected on the evidence**: (1) no allocation-failure line ever appears in the log (the v0.18.2 starvation signature `esp_dma_capable_malloc: Not enough heap` is absent); (2) at the instant of the wedge there was **25 KB internal free with a 12 KB largest block** — ample for the 1536-byte SDIO buffer; (3) the alarming 5 KB internal `min` was a **one-time transient at ~407 s** (SD-mount + WiFi + USB initialising together) that then stayed the historical watermark forever, ~15 min *before* the wedge — correlation, not cause. Lesson for the next session: the wedge signature is a corrupted SDIO length field from the C6, and heap is a red herring; **verify the actual failure signature is present before adopting a documented failure mode as the explanation.** Remaining live candidates, undiscriminated: **(a)** SPI-SD DMA and WiFi-SDIO DMA still sharing the GDMA controller (weaker coupling than the peripheral, consistent with "much better, not gone"); **(b)** an esp_hosted/C6 SDIO-link issue intrinsic to WiFi, independent of SD (40 MHz SDIO signal/timing integrity, or a driver bug over long uptime). The discriminating experiment is to run the SPI build **with no SD card** for 15–20 min: if it still wedges, SD is exonerated and the residual is esp_hosted/hardware-intrinsic (SPI mode is then simply the best available mitigation, possibly with no clean firmware cure — consistent with this board's long esp_hosted-fragility history documented above); if it stays clean, the SPI-SD path (candidate a) is still contributing and is the next target.

**RESOLVED (permanence mechanism + firmware recovery), 2026-07-10 — candidate (b) was right.** The residual wedge is **esp_hosted/C6-intrinsic, independent of SD**: it fires with the SD auto-archive soft-disabled and even while idle with no web UI open (operator observed it "just sitting there"), which answers the discriminating experiment above (SD is exonerated). Root-caused from the driver source + logged wedge events — and, crucially, the **permanence** was the fixable part:
- The wedge signature `H_SDIO_DRV: sdio_get_len_from_slave ... exceeds max [1536]` is not "corrupted length" — it's a legit **rolling pending-byte delta** `(slave_counter − host sdio_rx_byte_count) mod ESP_RX_BYTE_MAX` that occasionally exceeds the fixed RX_NONE buffer (1536). When it does, stock `sdio_drv.c` (`sdio_get_len_from_slave` → caller in `sdio_read_task`) returned `ESP_FAIL` and **`continue`d WITHOUT reading the bytes or advancing `sdio_rx_byte_count`** → the identical oversized delta recurred every interrupt → SDIO livelock → every RPC (the 1 Hz `0x126` `WifiStaGetApInfo` poll from `status_task`) times out forever. **Heap is NOT involved** (wedged with 65 KB internal free / 31 KB largest block — the "starvation" theory above is correctly rejected).
- **Fix (firmware recovery, hardware-verified):** patched `managed_components/espressif__esp_hosted/host/drivers/transport/sdio/sdio_drv.c` — removed the return-`ESP_FAIL` guard and, on an oversized delta, **DRAIN+DISCARD** the pending bytes in ≤1536 block-padded chunks (same CMD53 addressing as the normal read) then advance `sdio_rx_byte_count` so the delta re-aligns. One frame is lost (TCP/UDP retransmits); the link survives. Logs `SDIO RX oversize: len=.. host_cnt=.. slave_reg=.. - draining to recover`. **Verified on hardware: the recovery fired at ~42 min uptime (len=1916) and WiFi stayed fully up — web client reconnected, WS streaming continued, zero `0x126` timeouts.** So there IS a clean firmware cure for the *permanence*; the earlier "possibly no clean firmware cure" pessimism was wrong.
- **Re-apply patch:** `managed_components/` is git-ignored + wiped by fullclean, so the fix ships as a store/restore — `tools/patches/esp_hosted_sdio_drv.c.patched` (byte-exact) + `tools/patches/apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1` (idempotent, version-guarded). Re-run after any clean fetch, same as `apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1` / `apply_fatfs_exfat.ps1`.
- ⭐ **THE TX SIDE ALSO GIVES UP, AND STOCK REBOOTS THE DEVICE FOR IT — patched 2026-08-16, same file.** The recovery above covers RX only. Serial-captured at ~51 min uptime: `sdio_write_task` hit two CMD53 timeouts (`0x107`) **11 ms apart**, logged `Unrecoverable host sdio state, reset host mcu`, and called `_h_restart_host()`. That is a clean `esp_restart()`, so there is **no panic dump and `reset_reason` reads `SW_CPU_RESET`** — the operator sees an unexplained reboot with a clean log and nothing to report, which is the worst possible shape for a field fault. Stock `MAX_SDIO_WRITE_RETRY` is **2 with no delay**, so both attempts land inside 11 ms: not a real attempt at riding out a transient. Patched to **8 attempts with a 2 ms pause**, and on exhausting them the frame is **dropped** via the existing unlock/free path rather than restarting — exactly the precedent the RX side already sets (*one frame is lost, TCP/UDP retransmits, the link survives*). The restart is kept as a last resort behind `H_SDIO_TX_FAIL_STREAK_MAX` (32 **consecutive** failed packets = a genuinely dead link); any successful write clears the streak, so transients cannot accumulate toward a reboot. ⭐ **OBSERVED FIRING — TWICE, 2026-09-12, and it DID reboot the Tab5** (found 2026-09-18 while reading back an unrelated capture, so this note’s "not observed" claim was stale rather than wrong when written). At 09:59 and 11:07 UTC, 31 and 61 minutes into two different boots:
  ```
  E H_SDIO_DRV: sdio_is_write_buffer_available: 32 consecutive failures - link is dead, restarting
  I os_wrapper_esp: Restarting host
  ESP-ROM:esp32p4-eco2-20240710
  rst:0xc (SW_CPU_RESET),boot:0x20c (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
  ```
  ⛔ **So it is the WHOLE TAB5, not a contained C6 recovery.** `_h_restart_host()` is `hosted_restart_host()` in `host/port/src/os_wrapper.c`: it unregisters the `esp_wifi_stop` shutdown handler and calls **`esp_restart()`**. Confirmed from the ROM banner in the log, not inferred from the code. No panic, no #117 crash record, `reset_reason` = `SW_CPU_RESET` — exactly the shape this very paragraph calls the worst for a field fault, and with the radio attached each one is a warm reset, i.e. the **#74** QMX wedge.
  ⚠ **But that was the PRE-death-window code, and it is not what is on the bench now.** The logged text reads `32 consecutive failures - link is dead`; the current source reads `%u consecutive failures over %lld ms` and requires `qmx_unresp_streak >= 32` **AND** `down_ms >= QMX_SDIO_DEATH_MS`, so a burst of 32 failures inside the window no longer restarts anything. The message format is how the two are told apart in an old capture.
  ⚠ **The CURRENT guard has still never been seen** — neither firing nor holding a restart off. Its tell is a `slave answered again ... NOT restarting` line, and that is the thing a soak should be looking for. ⚠ **The stored `.patched` file was refreshed to match**, because a store/restore patch makes that file the source of truth: editing only `managed_components/` would have been silently reverted by the next `fullclean`.
- **Same run, and it reframes the "still open" question below:** 27 RX recoveries in 50 minutes, **bursty** rather than steadily worsening (per-minute rate by quarter 0.34 / 2.38 / 0.72 / 0.47), two of them 652 ms apart. That clustering is what the note below says would indicate drift and warrant a prevention fix on top of the recovery — so treat "rare and isolated" as **falsified**. BLE was enabled but unconnected, i.e. scanning (TODO #109/#131).
- **Still open (not blocking):** *why* the delta crosses 1536 — an occasional coalesced/oversized frame (looks likely: the first observed event was isolated, then clean) vs slow counter drift (block-only-xfer pads reads to 512-byte blocks but the counter advances by the unpadded length; if the C6 counts the padding, the host lags progressively). The recovery handles either. If a longer soak shows recoveries *accelerating/clustering*, that's drift and warrants a prevention (counter-accounting) fix on top; if they stay rare and isolated, the recovery alone suffices. The recovery log line captures `host_cnt`/`slave_reg` precisely so the pattern is directly observable. This **supersedes the "no auto-recovery exists once the RPC link wedges — reboot only" claim above**: on a patched build the link self-heals; that claim now applies only to *unpatched* builds.

### ⭐⭐ The RPC wedge is a DEADLOCK in a three-deep queue, not a leak (patch #18, 2026-09-11)
`0x126` timing out for ever while WiFi data keeps flowing has been in this file
since 2026-06-30, attributed each time to the SDIO transport. The transport
patches were all real and all necessary — and a **second, independent** cause was
still there. It is in `rpc_core.c`, and it is a self-deadlock.

`process_rpc_rx_msg()` queues a synchronous response **first** and only then looks
for the caller waiting on it. When the waiter has gone — its 5 s
`DEFAULT_RPC_RSP_TIMEOUT` expired, or `set_sync_resp_sem()` could not create a
semaphore and registered a **NULL** — the response lands in `rpc_rx_q` with
nothing left to take it out: `get_response()` is the only consumer, and it only
runs when a semaphore is posted, which only this thread does. The element is
immortal.

⛔ **`RPC_RX_QUEUE_SIZE` is 3.** So the third orphan fills the queue and the very
next response has **that same thread** block in `_h_queue_item()` on
`portMAX_DELAY`, for ever — it is both the only producer and the only thing that
could wake the consumer, so no slot can ever be freed. RPC is dead until reboot;
the data path never notices, which is exactly why the symptom has always been
"WiFi works, every RPC times out, reboot only".

⭐ **The dev-bench capture of 2026-09-11 fits to the event, not approximately:**

| uptime | what |
|---|---|
| 201.7 s | `sem create failed` ×2 → orphans 1 and 2 |
| 632.2 s | `sem create failed` ×1 → orphan 3, **queue now full** |
| 637.2 s | first `Timeout waiting for Resp for Req[0x126]` |
| 637→1431 s | **every** 0x126 times out, 1 per 5 s, 161 of them |
| 1103.2 s | `task still writing Rx data to queue!` ×1946 — the backlog reaches SDIO |
| 1431.4 s | `SDIO RX buffer alloc failed`, then the `sdio_write_task` assert |

Three sem failures, a queue of three, and the wedge starts 5 s after the third.

⚠ **"A per-RPC-failure leak of ~125 B" was my own wrong reading and is retracted.**
Internal free did fall 24 → 5 KB over those 160 failures (~122 B each) and PSRAM
1867 → 278 KB, and that linearity is what made it look like a leak. It is
**un-read RPC frames piling up behind a blocked thread** — the backlog, not an
allocation that is never freed. Fixing the deadlock removes both. Generalise it:
*a queue behind a stalled consumer produces a textbook-linear "leak" curve.*

**Fix — `tools/patches/apply_esp_hosted_rpc_orphan_resp.ps1`**, two edits:
- `set_sync_resp_sem()` refuses to register a **NULL** semaphore, so the request
  is never sent and no response can arrive to be orphaned. Safe because
  `RPC_SEND_REQ()` returns NULL without calling `rpc_wait_and_parse_sync_resp()`,
  so the freed `app_req` is never touched again.
- `process_rpc_rx_msg()` **asks for the waiter before queueing** and drops what
  nobody awaits, and bounds the enqueue at 1 s instead of `portMAX_DELAY`. Same
  precedent as the RX-oversize drain and patch #16: one frame lost, link lives.

⭐ **It also closes a silent correctness bug.** With even ONE orphan in the queue,
`get_response()` dequeues the **head** — the stale element — so every later
synchronous RPC returned the *previous* transaction's response, with no uid check
and no complaint. The 1 Hz RSSI/SSID poll had been reading one-behind.

⚠ **Registration ordering is what makes "drop it" safe**: `set_sync_resp_sem()`
runs **before** the request is queued for transmit, so there is no window in
which a legitimate response can arrive ahead of its own waiter.

Both new paths log (`no waiter for resp[..] uid .. - dropping`, `no sem for
req[..] - not sending`), deliberately — this runs on a task, not in an ISR, so
the #189 counter dance is unnecessary and a timestamped line is better.

⭐⭐ **HARDWARE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-12, dev bench, in ONE 30-minute run:**

```
sem create failed : 17
no sem for req    : 17   <- every one refused before the request was sent
no waiter dropping: 0
0x126 timeouts    : 0
```

**Seventeen seedings, no wedge.** `sem create failed` is the exact
memory-pressure condition that creates an orphan, and on the unpatched build of
2026-09-11 the **third** one filled the 3-deep `rpc_rx_q` and the link was dead
five seconds later (161 consecutive `0x126` timeouts, one per 5 s, until
reboot). Here there were seventeen and RPC never missed a beat — `/api/status`'s
RSSI kept changing, which IS the `0x126` `WifiStaGetApInfo` call answering.

⭐ **The 1:1 ratio proves the MECHANISM, not just the outcome.** Every
`sem create failed` is followed by `no sem for req`, i.e. the first half of the
patch refusing to register a NULL semaphore, so the request is never
transmitted and no orphan response can exist. That is why `no waiter for resp
... dropping` reads **0**: the second half is the backstop for a race that the
first half prevents outright. A soak showing the drop line instead would be
equally valid confirmation — this is the stronger of the two shapes.

⚠ **Do not read the 0 as "the drop path is dead code."** It covers the window
where a waiter times out at 5 s while its response is already in flight, which
needs a slow round trip rather than a failed allocation. Unobserved, not
unreachable.

**RE-ENABLED 2026-07-19 (`SD_ARCHIVE_DISABLED 0`) — the FT8-collapse blocker was #51 all along.** The archive was shelved 2026-07-10 not for the WiFi wedge (exonerated above — SD-independent, self-heals) but because a live test showed FT8 decode collapsing to `cand=140/dec=0` zero-clusters with a card mounted, blamed on internal-heap starvation. That is the *exact* #51 signature (USB ISO audio lost at the wire), root-caused + fixed 2026-07-19. Re-verified on hardware: with a card mounted the internal heap still craters (min ~12 KB, lblk ~15 KB — the SD tax is real, ~14–49 KB depending on card) **yet FT8 decodes 35–54/slot with no collapse, no WiFi wedge, no SDIO-recovery events.** So the low heap was never the cause. The archive is now a full **grab-and-go station backup** (`storage/sd_archive.c`): mirrors `qso.adi`, `qmx-config.txt` (settings + secrets), `lotw_cert.b64`+`lotw_key.b64` (via `sd_archive_mark_lotw_dirty()`, hooked in the `/api/lotw_cert` handler), the diag log, and a self-describing version-stamped `README.txt` (written each mount) that warns the card holds credentials in clear (WiFi pw, QRZ/eQSL, LoTW private key) — inherent to a restorable backup. Deliberately NOT mirrored: the LoTW TQ8 (derived/regenerable, signing-on-write is heavy) and screenshots. A 30 s `sd_arch: heartbeat` + per-burst SPI timing were added as soak instrumentation. FAT32 (≤32 GB) works with no patch — the exFAT patch below is only for >32 GB exFAT cards. If FT8 ever zero-clusters *only* with a card in, the fallback is gating the mount off in FT8/FT4 mode (the tightest-heap case); not needed as of this writing.

Two config requirements, both **outside the default ESP-IDF FatFs config**:
- **Long filenames**: `CONFIG_FATFS_LFN_HEAP=y` + `CONFIG_FATFS_MAX_LFN=255` + `CONFIG_FATFS_USE_LABEL=y` in `sdkconfig` (the default was `LFN_NONE`, i.e. 8.3 only — our paths like `qmx-panadapter/` and `qmx-config.txt` need LFN; `USE_LABEL` is required because the exFAT code path in `ff.c` references `FF_USE_LABEL` as a C expression, not just `#if`).
- **exFAT** (large cards >32 GB are exFAT by default): ESP-IDF v5.4.4 hardcodes `#define FF_FS_EXFAT 0` in `$IDF_PATH/components/fatfs/src/ffconf.h` with **no Kconfig option** to flip it. `tools/patches/apply_fatfs_exfat.ps1` flips it to `1` (idempotent). Because this edits the **pinned IDF install tree** (not the project), it's wiped on IDF reinstall and must be re-applied per build machine — same model as `apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1`. No compile guard ties exFAT to LFN, so it's harmless to other projects on this IDF (adds exFAT code; FAT still works).
- **Sector size**: `CONFIG_FATFS_SECTOR_512=y` (not the default `SECTOR_4096`) — real field SD cards use 512-byte sectors; the 4096 setting caused mount failures on those cards.

### Web microSD file browser (`net/filebrowser.c`) — how users read the card without pulling it (NOT YET FIELD-VERIFIED)
The way to get at the SD card from a connected computer is a plain **web page**, not a mounted network drive. Served at **`http://<ip>/files`** (linked from the web UI's bottom-bar "Files ▸" menu as "SD Files"): a self-contained dark page (HTML/JS inlined as a C string in `filebrowser.c` — no embedded-file asset, all single-quoted attrs + backtick templates so it needs zero C escaping) that browses `/sdcard`, downloads, uploads, and deletes. Backing endpoints: `GET /api/files?path=<rel>` (cJSON dir listing), `GET /api/file?path=<rel>` (download), `POST /api/file?path=<rel>` (raw-body upload/overwrite), `DELETE /api/file?path=<rel>` (recursive). Paths are query-param based (no URL wildcards), rooted at `/sdcard`, with a conservative `strstr(dec,"..")` traversal guard. **Every SD op runs under `sd_archive_lock()`, and downloads/uploads also `webserver_ws_set_paused(true)` + `dsp_set_transfer_quiet(true)` for their duration** — same SD-during-WiFi discipline as the reader "Save offline" / log-download paths (this is the wedge-prone combo). Fully verified from the PC side (list/download/upload/delete/404/traversal-400 all pass); on-device browser rendering not yet eyeballed by the operator at time of writing. `max_uri_handlers` is 28 (21 API + WS + 5 file-browser + headroom).

**WebDAV was built first and deliberately REMOVED — do not re-add it.** A full WebDAV server (`net/webdav.c`, wildcard `/dav*`, all methods incl. faked LOCK) was implemented and *worked* — it mounted as a drive letter on Windows and PROPFIND/GET/PUT/MOVE/DELETE all functioned. It was dropped because the **Windows client-side setup** is a non-technical-user trap: the WebClient service must be Running (it defaults to Stopped/Manual → Windows silently falls back to SMB `\\host\dav` and fails), `BasicAuthLevel` wants `2` for plain HTTP, and the folder must be typed as a `http://` URL (a bare `host/dav` becomes an SMB UNC). Across a Win/Mac/Linux user base that friction isn't worth it; a URL in a browser has none of it. Two implementation lessons worth keeping if WebDAV is ever revisited: (1) the Windows redirector parses the 207 XML **strictly** — a single stray byte (an off-by-one length on a `httpd_resp_send_chunk` literal put a NUL into the body, and another dropped a closing `>`) yields error `0x80070043` "network name cannot be found" even though curl reports 207 fine; always use `httpd_resp_sendstr_chunk` for literal XML, never hand-counted lengths. (2) WebDAV needs `config.uri_match_fn = httpd_uri_match_wildcard` and ~12 handler slots. USB Mass-Storage ("stick mode") was also considered and rejected for now: it'd be the best cross-OS UX but needs the P4 OTG as a *device* (the QMX uses a separate port on this unit, so it's physically possible) plus a reboot-in/reboot-out mode with the radio off and the SD detached from the Tab5's own use while active — more work than the web page for the same everyday need.

### USB bulk-error assert-reboot → graceful failure (IDF-tree patch — must be re-applied)
ESP-IDF v5.4.4's `hcd_dwc.c` `_buffer_parse_bulk()` `assert()`s if a bulk transfer completes with a non-SUCCESS descriptor status — field-observed 2026-07-16 (serial-captured: `assert failed: _buffer_parse_bulk hcd_dwc.c:2406` mid-FT8-session, a transient bulk transaction error on the CDC-ACM/CAT pipe while UAC streamed on the same host) → full device reboot. Patched to report `USB_TRANSFER_STATUS_ERROR` with 0 bytes instead (identical semantics to the driver's own `_buffer_parse_error()` path); the CDC layer retries and `cat.c`'s poll task already tolerates ~20 consecutive transient failures. Deliberately NO log line inside the patch — it can run inside the HCD's critical section (the cyan-flash rule). Because this edits the **pinned IDF install tree**, it's wiped on IDF reinstall and must be re-applied per build machine: `tools/patches/apply_hcd_bulk_error_recovery.ps1` (idempotent, version-guarded) — the 4th standing patch script alongside `apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1`, `apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1`, `apply_fatfs_exfat.ps1`. Only one occurrence ever observed; the patch converts a reboot into a retried CAT poll.

### USB hub root-port recover abort → tolerant (IDF-tree patch #5 — must be re-applied)
ESP-IDF v5.4.4's `hub.c` `root_port_req()` feeds `hcd_port_recover()` into `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` — serial-captured 2026-08-03: `usb_replug()`'s root-port power cycle (the TODO #75 zombie-device recovery) raced the hub FSM's queued `PORT_REQ_RECOVER`, the port had already left the RECOVERY state, recover returned `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` → abort() → reboot ("hub.c line 462"). `tools/patches/apply_hub_recover_tolerant.ps1` (idempotent, version-guarded, **5th standing patch script**) downgrades the recover and the follow-on POWER_ON to log-and-continue, mirroring the driver's own "We allow this to fail" precedent on PORT_REQ_DISABLE. Same maintenance model as patch #4: edits the pinned IDF tree, wiped on IDF reinstall, re-apply per build machine. Hardware-verified: replugs against wedged/zombie devices no longer abort. Full two-wedge story in TODO #74/#75 and memory `project_qmx_reenumerate_after_reboot`.

### `cdc_acm_host_close()` abort → retry then tolerate (managed-component patch #6 — must be re-applied)
Stock `cdc_acm_host.c` ends `cdc_acm_host_close()` with `usb_host_interface_release()` inside `ESP_ERROR_CHECK`. That call returns `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` while **any** endpoint of the interface still has a URB in flight, and it allows the client task exactly `vTaskDelay(10)` to reap them — which at this project's `CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ=1000` is **10 MILLISECONDS**, not the 100 ms the vendor comment reads like. So a busy port turns a transient into `abort()`, i.e. a reboot. Serial-captured 2026-08-16 while building the QMX terminal (#147): closing a session on the radio's second CDC interface aborted at `cdc_acm_host.c:717` with `0x103`. **`tools/patches/apply_cdc_acm_close_tolerant.ps1`** (idempotent, marker-guarded, **6th standing patch script**) retries the release 16 × 20 ms — that addresses the actual cause, the window simply being too short — and only then logs and continues, leaking the claim rather than killing the firmware. Same precedent as the UAC fork's forced teardown above. ⚠ Edits `managed_components/`, which is **git-ignored and wiped by `fullclean`**, a dependency refresh, and the release process's `rm -r managed_components/` — re-run it after any of those, alongside `apply_esp_hosted_psram.ps1` and `apply_esp_hosted_sdio_recovery.ps1`. If a close ever starts abort()ing at that line again, this patch is missing.

**Two wrong turns on the way, both falsified on hardware — do not re-take them.** (1) *"Fixed by timing"*: a non-blocking RX callback plus a wait-for-quiet made the abort rarer, and it was called fixed off a **single** successful close; a repeat-cycle test then aborted on the fourth. Timing changes the odds of a race, not the race. (2) *"Then never close at all"*: keeping the interface claimed removes that abort by construction and trades it for a worse one — holding a second CDC interface across a QMX power cycle abort()s in IDF's hub layer (`dev_tree_node_dev_gone(NULL, 0)`, `hub.c:435`), and power-cycling the radio is routine. Every abort in this family is also a Tab5 warm reset with the radio attached, i.e. the documented #74 trigger, so each one wedged the QMX until a power cycle — which is why they cost so much bench time.

⚠ **#74 INVESTIGATED PROPERLY 2026-08-11 — SIX approaches FALSIFIED on hardware, recovery AND prevention. The original "needs a QMX power cycle" diagnosis STANDS, and this is now well evidenced rather than assumed.**

The operator refused the QMX-side diagnosis, reasonably: *"Stan and others have numerous examples (windows linux mac) where they can sleep, unplug and replug without the QMX going stale."* So it was re-tested against a really-wedged radio. Every one of these produced the **identical empty data stage** — `Unexpected (8) device response length`, i.e. the setup packet and **zero descriptor bytes**, ~350 ms after port-on:

| Tried | Result |
|---|---|
| `RESET_HOLD_MS` 30 → **50** | no change |
| `RESET_HOLD_MS` → **200** (Linux's `HUB_LONG_RESET_TIME`), recovery 100 | no change |
| `ENUM_SHORT_DESC_REQ_LEN` 8 → **64** (what Windows and Linux request) | no change — expected 72, got 8 |
| VBUS off 2 s + root-port power cycle | no change (2 attempts, logged) |
| Repeated retries | already happened — see below |
| **Orderly shutdown before flashing** (`usb_shutdown`: TX disarmed, `TA0;RX;`, CDC closed, audio alt-setting 0, port power off) | **no change** — and this had never actually been run before, since esptool resets the chip without invoking it |
| **Orderly shutdown + PHYSICAL VBUS removal**, held down through the reflash and the entire boot, then restored by the expander (`bsp_set_usb_5v_en`, P3) | **no change** — the closest thing to a physical unplug this board can produce |

**So do not spend another evening on host-side timing.** The radio is not answering address 0 in that state and nothing the host does changes it. All the sdkconfig knobs are back at the IDF defaults deliberately; `sdkconfig.defaults` records the negative result so nobody raises them hoping again.

**Two of my own claims that evening were wrong, in opposite directions — both corrected in place:**
- *"Our detector never retried once"* — **wrong.** `num_devices` is NON-zero after a failed enumeration, so `usb_replug.c`'s zombie branch does fire on this wedge; it replugged twice and achieved nothing. The enum-failure branch now also replugs (it covers the `num_devices == 0` case the zombie branch cannot see) but that is **a closed hole, not a cure**.
- *"It is a host-side retry gap and it is fixed"* — **also wrong**, and written under the operator's (fair) pressure. ESP-IDF's missing enum retry IS real (issue **#17918**, open, no fix, same failure class on a HID joystick and USB sticks, diagnosed as timing) and worth knowing, but it is **not** the cause here.

**PREVENTION was tested too, and also fails.** The wedge follows a Tab5 warm reset *with the radio attached mid-session* (a cold boot enumerates fine), so `util/usb_shutdown.c` looked like the answer — and its own comment names why it had never been exercised: *"it cannot cover esptool, which resets the chip from outside with no warning at all."* The handler runs from `esp_restart()`; a flash asserts RTS and nothing runs, and every test to date ran `idf.py flash` directly. So it was run by hand via `/api/cmd`, twice: once as-is, and once with a real VBUS removal added (that function never cut physical 5 V — only `usb_replug.c` does). **Both still wedged.** The VBUS version is reverted: no benefit, and it would leave USB dead until a reboot if the operator pressed the button and changed their mind.

**Conclusion: there is nothing more to try from the host.** Six approaches, covering both recovery and prevention, against a radio that answers `GET_DESCRIPTOR(DEVICE)` at address 0 with an **empty data stage** — setup packet acknowledged, zero descriptor bytes, and the host attempting enumeration repeatedly. The next move is a firmware question for Hans G0UPL, and the draft is in `docs/`.

⚠ **Both branches are now LOG-ONLY — the "power-cycle the QMX" toasts were removed in v1.8.0** at the operator's request ("irritating and for no use"). They fired every few minutes at a QMX that was merely switched off, which is an ordinary state rather than a fault, and the screen already says *"Now turn on or reboot your QMX/+"* whenever CAT is down — the same instruction, in the right place. The `ESP_LOGW` lines in `util/usb_replug.c` are unchanged, so both wedges stay diagnosable from a diag log; the detection and the recovery are untouched. Don't reinstate the toasts; if this ever needs to be visible again, put it in the wait prompt rather than adding a second thing that pops up.

### A channel error without the halt bit abort()s the device (IDF-tree patch #7 — must be re-applied)
ESP-IDF v5.4.4's `usb_dwc_hal.c` `usb_dwc_hal_chan_decode_intr()` guards its error
branch with `HAL_ASSERT(chan_intrs & USB_DWC_LL_INTR_CHAN_CHHLTD)` under the comment
*"An error should have halted the channel"*. That is an **assumption**, and ESP32-P4
v1.3 violates it — serial-captured 2026-08-18 during an overnight soak of the
released v1.8.5, at **1 h 57 m** of a completely healthy FT8 session (radio streaming
46,806 pairs/s, FT8 mid-capture, 55 KB internal free, 0 SDIO timeouts): a channel
error interrupt arrived with no CHHLTD and the assert aborted the device.

⛔ **The reboot is not the expensive part.** An abort is a warm reset with the QMX
attached, which is the documented **#74** trigger — so the radio then failed to
re-enumerate and stayed dead for the remaining **5 h 26 m** of the night (4 ENUM
failures, then `RX 0 pairs/s` until morning). One assert cost the whole session, and
the operator's report was "the QMX wedged during the night" — the QMX was fine.
**When a QMX wedge is reported after an unattended run, look for a Tab5 abort first.**

**The recovery was already written**, immediately below the assert: the same block
classifies the error (STALL/BBLEER/BNA/XCS_XACT), clears `flags.active` and returns
`USB_DWC_HAL_CHAN_EVENT_ERROR`, which the HCD handles — and patch #4 already made
that layer tolerant. So `tools/patches/apply_usb_dwc_hal_chan_error_tolerant.ps1`
(idempotent, marker-guarded) just drops the assert and lets the existing path run.
**No logging inside it** — that code executes in the USB interrupt path (cyan-flash
rule). Edits the **pinned IDF tree**, so an IDF reinstall wipes it;
`tools/check_patches.py` now fails the build if it is missing (mutation-tested).

⚠ **This is the THIRD assert of the same family**, after #4 (`hcd_dwc.c` bulk error)
and #5 (`hub.c` recover in `ESP_ERROR_CHECK`) — and #8 below is the fourth.
Generalise it: **IDF's USB stack asserts on hardware states it treats as impossible,
and on this board they happen.** When a new USB abort appears, look for a
`HAL_ASSERT`/`ESP_ERROR_CHECK`/bare `abort()` guarding a "cannot happen" case with a
working error path sitting right beside it.

⚠ **v1.8.5 shipped WITHOUT this fix.** Rate is unknown beyond once in ~2 h on this
bench under FT8 — earlier 10 h+ soaks never showed it, so do not assume a rate from
one event.

### An "impossible" pipe event abort()s the device (IDF-tree patch #8 — must be re-applied)
`hcd_dwc.c`'s `_buffer_parse_error()` switches on `status_flags.pipe_event` and its
`default:` is a bare `abort()` under *"HCD_PIPE_EVENT_URB_DONE and
HCD_PIPE_EVENT_ERROR_URB_NOT_AVAIL should not occur here"*. Same assumption, same
outcome: serial-captured **2026-08-18 in a soak of the RELEASED v1.8.6**, at **7 h
06 m** of a completely healthy FT8 receive session (26 decodes/slot, 49,460 pairs/s,
53 KB internal free, `idle0` 61 %). And again the reboot was the cheap part — the
warm reset with the radio attached triggered **#74**, the QMX never re-enumerated,
and the operator's report was *"the QMX was wedged"*. **That inversion has now
happened twice in two nights: a QMX wedge after an unattended run means look for a
Tab5 abort FIRST.**

**How the PC was tied to the line, because it does not read as obvious.**
`addr2line 0x480f3e31` says `_buffer_parse` **line 2578** — the `default:` of a
*different* switch, on `pipe->ep_char.type`, which is declared `type : 2` with all
four enum values cased and is therefore **unreachable by construction**.
`_buffer_parse_error` is `static inline` into `_buffer_parse`, and the two identical
bare `abort()`s **fold into one block**, so addr2line reports the surviving line.
`pipe_event` is `: 8`, so *its* `default:` is reachable. Corroborating:
`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL=2`, so a failing `assert()` prints
`assert failed: … file:line` — **nothing printed**, which is what proves it was a
plain `abort()` rather than either `assert()` at the top of `_buffer_parse`.
**Generalise the method**: when a bare abort's line looks unreachable, check for
identical folded `abort()` blocks and an inlined static function, and use the field
widths to eliminate.

Fix follows **patch #4's own precedent in the same file**: `actual_num_bytes` is
already 0 before the switch, so the `default:` only sets
`transfer->status = USB_TRANSFER_STATUS_ERROR` — exactly what every other branch
does — and the class driver retries. `tools/patches/apply_hcd_buffer_parse_error_tolerant.ps1`.
⚠ **`hcd_dwc.c` now carries TWO of our patches (#4 and #8) with separate markers**;
applying one does not apply the other, and `check_patches.py` has a row for each.

⚠ **Patches #7 and #8 COUNT rather than log (#189), and the count is the marker.**
Neither may log (interrupt path, cyan-flash rule), which made both unverifiable: a
clean log cannot distinguish "never happened" from "happened and was handled", so
they could only ever be failed-to-be-contradicted. Both now increment a `uint32_t`
(`main/util/usb_patch_counters.c` — defined in **firmware** and only `extern`-declared
inside the patched IDF files, deliberately that way round so a missing patch leaves
the count at 0 instead of failing the link). Reported by
`usb_patch_counters_report()` from the 10 s heap watchdog **only when a count
changes**, and in `/api/status` as `usb_patch`. Because a silent-but-tolerant patch
is as good as no patch for diagnosis, **`check_patches.py`'s marker for both is the
counter symbol**, not a date comment.

⭐ **BOTH COUNTERS HAVE NOW FIRED, AND THAT SETTLES IT — 2026-09-01, dev bench,
`/api/status` reading `usb_patch: {chan_err_no_halt: 1, unexpected_pipe_event: 1}`
in a single ~5 h session.** They are plain RAM globals zeroed at boot, so both
events happened in that one uptime. On an unpatched build each would have been an
`abort()`, i.e. a warm reset with the radio attached, i.e. the documented **#74**
wedge — so this bench would have lost the QMX twice in an afternoon. The earlier
caveat here (*"neither counter has been observed firing yet — correct-by-
construction, not hardware-confirmed"*) is retired: patches #7 and #8 are now
hardware-confirmed, and #189's whole argument — that a silent tolerant patch is
indistinguishable from a missing one — is what made the confirmation readable at
a glance instead of needing a reproduction.

### A DMA buffer with no URB abort()s the device (IDF-tree patch #9 — must be re-applied)
`hcd_dwc.c`'s `_buffer_parse()` opens with
`assert(buffer_to_parse->urb != NULL)`. Field-observed 2026-09-01: **the operator
restarted the QMX**, the Tab5 flashed cyan and rebooted. A power cycle with
isochronous transfers in flight tears the pipe down underneath the parser, so the
buffer at `fr_idx` can legitimately have been released already — the assert calls
that impossible, and on this board it happens.

⭐ **The #117 crash record had the entire thing on the next boot with nothing to
reproduce**, which is exactly what that feature exists for:
```
assert failed: _buffer_parse hcd_dwc.c:2573 (buffer_to_parse->urb != NULL)
task   : USB UAC Host   core 0   after 397.023 s of uptime
```

⛔ **The reboot is not the expensive part** — an abort is a warm reset with the
radio attached, i.e. the documented **#74** trigger, so restarting the radio can
cost the radio. That inversion (a Tab5 abort reported as "the QMX wedged") has
now happened three ways.

**Fix:** there is nothing to parse into a URB that is not there, so the buffer is
skipped — but the ring bookkeeping still advances exactly as the tail of
`_buffer_parse()` advances it (`flags.val = 0`, `fr_idx++`,
`buffer_num_to_parse--`, `buffer_num_to_fill++`), or `_buffer_flush_all()` spins
on counts that never drain. On an isochronous stream the cost is one lost audio
packet. `tools/patches/apply_hcd_buffer_parse_no_urb_tolerant.ps1`. Counts rather
than logs (#189, interrupt path), reported as `usb_patch.buffer_parse_no_urb`.

⚠ **`hcd_dwc.c` now carries THREE of our patches (#4, #8 and #9)** with separate
markers; applying one does not apply the others, and `check_patches.py` has a row
for each. **Eleven standing patches now** — the count in older notes is stale.

⚠ **This is the FIFTH of the family** (#4, #5, #7, #8, #9). The generalisation
stands and keeps paying: *IDF's USB stack asserts on hardware states it treats as
impossible, and on this board they happen.*

### USB mouse — WORKS mouse-alone (hw-verified 2026-07-20); simultaneous-with-QMX blocked by the hub/TT wall
Frank K4FMH asked for mouse support (USB or BT). **The full USB-mouse stack works and is hardware-verified**: a mouse plugged **directly** into USB-A (no hub, QMX not attached) enumerates, and `main/usb_hid_mouse.c` (HID host, boot-protocol report → cursor accumulation) + the LVGL pointer indev in `ui.c` (`ui_mouse_init()`, `mouse_read_cb`, white-circle cursor on `lv_layer_top()`) give a moving cursor that drives every menu/button/drawer via normal LVGL clicks. The 90° rotation transform (`point.x = ly; point.y = (W-1) - lx`, the inverse of LVGL's own `indev_pointer_proc` ROTATION_90 map) was correct first try — cursor tracks and clicks land accurately. Verified with the mouse as the SOLE USB device.

**The catch — mouse and QMX cannot be used at the same time.** Both are FS/LS devices; the ESP32-P4 has one USB host and putting two devices on it needs a hub, but a hub puts them behind a High-Speed hub that requires a Transaction Translator — and **ESP-IDF 5.4.4's USB host has no TT support**. Hardware-proven with hub+QMX+mouse:
```
HUB: Connected device is FS, transaction translator (TT) is not supported
EXT_PORT: [1:2] Port disabled   (QMX)   EXT_PORT: [1:4] Port disabled   (mouse)
```
The Tab5's USB-A host is the P4's **UTMI PHY = High-Speed only** (`usb_phy.c`: *"UTMI can be HighSpeed only"*). The QMX (Full-Speed) and mouse (Low/Full-Speed) behind a **HS hub** need the hub's **Transaction Translator**, and **ESP-IDF 5.4.4's USB host implements no TT** (`components/usb/ext_hub.c`/`hub.c`) → every slower device behind the hub is disabled. All three escapes are closed for us: can't add TT (not in 5.4.4, IDF is pinned — P4 ECO2 settings baked into sdkconfig); can't force the host to FS (UTMI is HS-only; a FS root would run a hub TT-free); the P4's separate FSLS (Full-Speed) PHY exists but is routed to GPIO pins, not the USB-A connector. A **USB 1.1 (FS-only) hub** *might* work (no TT in a FS hub) but that hardware is essentially extinct — untested. Direct connection is unaffected: the QMX (or a lone mouse) plugged straight into USB-A enumerates FS fine; only a hub triggers the wall.

**For SIMULTANEOUS mouse+QMX the only path is Bluetooth** (BLE HID / HOGP over the C6 via esp_hosted) — not pursued: `CONFIG_BT_ENABLED` is off, it's a new subsystem on this board's most fragile link (the C6/SDIO path). Deferred, not rejected.

**Implementation (all present, mouse-alone works):** `main/usb_hid_mouse.c`/`.h` (HID host install, boot-protocol mouse report → landscape cursor accumulation, `usb_hid_mouse_get()`), the LVGL pointer indev in `ui.c` (`ui_mouse_init()` called from `main.c` after `ui_init()`), `CONFIG_USB_HOST_HUBS_SUPPORTED=y`, and the `espressif/usb_host_hid` dependency. Harmless with a direct QMX (HID host task idles, cursor hidden until a mouse enumerates). **Decision 2026-07-20: KEEP in the build but DO NOT advertise it** — it works only QMX-unplugged (setup/manual-reading/menu use, not live operating), so it stays undocumented for users until the BT path enables mouse-while-operating. Not a release headline; no user-facing note. If cleaning up instead: revert `usb_hid_mouse.*`, `ui_mouse_init()` (ui.c + its call/decl), the sdkconfig flag, and the `usb_host_hid` dependency.

### USB host DWC DMA buffers → PSRAM (sdkconfig.defaults, v0.19.2)
`CONFIG_USB_HOST_DWC_DMA_CAP_MEMORY_IN_PSRAM=y`. Without it, USB endpoint allocation for UAC (audio) and CDC-ACM (CAT) can fail on a QMX reconnect/power-cycle: once WiFi has connected (~100 KB of internal SRAM gone), the internal heap fragments down to ~31 KB largest free block, but EP alloc needs a contiguous `MALLOC_CAP_DMA | MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL` block. The first-boot connection always worked (heap still ~148 KB unfragmented at that point), masking the bug until the QMX was reconnected/power-cycled with WiFi already up. The ESP32-P4's DWC USB DMA engine can address PSRAM directly, so this routes the transfer descriptor lists and data buffers there instead, sidestepping internal-SRAM fragmentation. Verified fixed on hardware.

### LVGL memory pool → PSRAM (`main/util/lv_pool_shim.h`)
LVGL's builtin tlsf allocator normally reserves a static 256 KB array in internal BSS (`CONFIG_LV_MEM_SIZE_KILOBYTES=256`). `lv_pool_shim.h` is force-included into the `lvgl__lvgl` component build (via `main/CMakeLists.txt`) and defines `LV_MEM_POOL_ALLOC` to call `heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT)` instead, freeing that 256 KB of internal SRAM for FreeRTOS/SDMMC/USB host/LWIP/the web server. Explicit and harmless — LVGL doesn't care where its pool memory comes from.

### A liveness flag must be claimed by the SPAWNER, never set inside the task (#199, 2026-08-20)
`s_ft8_task_alive` and `s_decode_task_alive` were each set as their own task's
**first statement**, so both meant *"this task has begun RUNNING"* — while every
reader (the single-instance guard in `ft8_self_test()`, and the 1 Hz respawn
watchdog in `ft8_screen_view.c`) needs *"this task EXISTS"*. Between the two
sits the whole scheduling delay.

**On this board that delay is long, not a hair's breadth.** Both tasks are
created at `tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1` — the **lowest priority in the system** — under
the capture task, `fft_task` (4), taskLVGL, the feeds (2) and httpd (5). Taking
over a second to get a first slice is ordinary; the same starvation was measured
directly the same day in `ft8_screen.c`'s `record_decode`, where a **mutex holder
went ~190 ms with no CPU** and its own log line surfaced out of order.

So the FT8-entry path spawned the task, the watchdog looked a second later, saw
a flag still false, logged `respawning` and spawned a **second** one. Both built
the monitor pool and the second double-freed the shared FFT scratch — almost
certainly the `tlsf_free` double-free reboot open and unreproduced since v1.3.0.

**The rule:** set the flag *before* `xTaskCreate`, and clear it if creation
fails — otherwise nothing ever clears it and the subsystem is dead for the
session with its watchdog refusing to retry. **Do not "fix" this with a grace
period in the watchdog**: that only makes the race rarer, and this file already
records two attempts falsified on hardware for exactly that reason (the
`cdc_acm_host_close()` abort). *Timing changes the odds of a race, not the race.*

A sweep of every task entry point in `main/` found **three** flags of this shape
and only these two were real. `wifi.c`'s `s_wifi_started` is a **false positive**
and must stay as it is — it records that `esp_wifi_start()` succeeded and is set
at each call site right after the call, which is the correct pattern.

⭐ **Exercised on hardware 2026-08-20 with the radio on: 7 FT8 entries, 2 spawns,
1 legitimate respawn, 5 correct guard refusals, and EXACTLY ONE pool build per
spawn** — zero `rebuilt with no teardown`, zero crashes. Read as
*not contradicted*, not as proven: reproducing the original race needs the
watchdog to look inside the spawn-to-first-run window, which cannot be forced on
demand. The guard is demonstrably live though — a respawn was immediately
followed by refusals, i.e. the flag went true at once.

### ⛔ An OTA needs ~14 KB of internal heap it did not have, and the FIRST symptom said so
Four hardware watchdog resets, always at the end of a long download with the
radio streaming. Every theory about scheduling was wrong and cost a 6-minute
download each: the verify measures **894 ms with the FFT running and 890 ms
with it stood down**, four milliseconds apart. `dsp_set_transfer_quiet()`, a
quiesce handshake and a feed pause were all built and all failed to fix it.

**The very first symptom was a memory error stating the cause plainly** —
`ota_update_start()` returning *"Could not start the update task"* is
`xTaskCreate` failing to find 8 KB of contiguous INTERNAL RAM (the task cannot
use a PSRAM stack; flash writes run with the cache off). In FT8 with the radio
streaming, the largest internal block was **6,912 bytes**.

`size` → `size-components` → `nm --size-sort` — the trio this file already
prescribes — named it in four minutes and no hardware: `s_toc` (9,472 B, the
manual's contents list) and `s_pub` (4,608 B, a spur map for a feature that
defaults OFF), both in internal `.bss`. `EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR` recovered **14,084
bytes**; largest block 6,912 → 19,456, DMA pool 4,683 → 20,231, and the
**minimum** internal free over a whole run 2,519 → 10,067.

⭐ **The A/B that settles it:** same mode, same audio load, ~300 s download, one
variable. Four runs below ~12 KB free took the watchdog; two above ~14 KB
completed at 304 s and 328 s. **`libmain.a` still owns 153,906 of 170,704 bytes
of `.bss`** — `s_table` (11,264 B) is the next candidate, and the last audit's
52 KB has crept back.

⚠ Also fixed on the way, and it is NOT OTA-specific: `fft_task`'s
transfer-quiet branch read ONE window (1024 pairs) then slept 50 ms — ~20,000
pairs/s against the ~48,000 the QMX produces — so it fell behind 2:1 and
overflowed the audio ring for the whole of **every upload**, while its own
comment claimed it prevented exactly that.

### ⛔ A message must never disable navigation
The v1.9.3 bar takeover stood down the edge strips and the burger "for the
duration of the download". The banner then moved to the READY state, which
persists until the operator decides — so it locked them out of every swipe and
the drawer INDEFINITELY, with a staged update sitting on the bar. Reported from
the bench as "no way to swipe away from FT8". The takeover was removed
entirely; if one ever comes back, it is display-only.

### ⛔ Paint and animate under ONE display_lock()
`ui_set_update_line_pulsing()` painted text under one `display_lock()` and
started its animation under a second. When the first timed out and the second
did not — exactly what to expect right after a flash verify starves taskLVGL —
the OLD text was left breathing forever and every later tick early-returned on
"something is already pulsing". Both now happen under one lock, the flag is set
only if that lock was taken, and the early-out is on CONTENT CHANGED.

⚠ **Two screenshots are not a test for an animation.** I took two ~90 s apart,
measured identical brightness, and concluded it was not breathing. Ease-in-out
lingers near full opacity; the operator's eyes were right and my measurement
was too weak to contradict them.

### ⛔ `/api/cmd` answers an unknown action with `unknown action` and HTTP 200
So a mistyped action is a **silent no-op**, and if the response is piped to
`/dev/null` the test looks like it ran and changed nothing.

This cost real time on 2026-08-20. The screen-switch action is **`set_screen`**,
not `screen`. Twelve "panadapter↔FT8 toggles" sent `{"action":"screen",...}`,
every one returned `unknown action`, and the resulting perfectly flat heap was
briefly written up as "#38's leak is gone" — against a predicted ~2 MB. Worse, a
**mechanism was invented to explain it**: that `ui_request_base_mode()` was
gated behind `qmx_wait_poll_cb()`'s "Waiting for QMX..." prompt. That claim was
never tested and is **false**; with the correct action the switch completes
normally. It had already been committed to this file, TODO.md and memory before
the typo was found.

**Two rules from it.** Check the BODY of an `/api/cmd` response, never just the
status. And when a result is surprising, confirm the action executed at all
before reasoning about why it behaved that way — an invented mechanism for a
result that never happened is worse than no explanation, because it reads as
knowledge.

### Task stacks on this board are TINY — a multi-hundred-byte local is a bug until proven otherwise
Measured stack bounds from real crash dumps: **`sys_evt` 2808 B**, **`settings_flush` 3064 B**. `taskLVGL` is ~8 KB. So a "small" local array is not small here. Instances so far, all the same bug: the v0.20.1 pounce crash (11 KB `ft8_call_t snap[]` on taskLVGL — the compiler reserves the frame at the prologue **unconditionally**, so it fired on every pounce regardless of the code path taken), and three in one sitting on 2026-08-05 while adding the WiFi known-network list — a `wifi_known_t[6]` (~590 B) on `sys_evt` (twice: the GOT_IP log and the backoff probe) and on `settings_flush`, each producing `Guru Meditation: Stack protection fault` and a **crash loop**.

⛔ **AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN THE SAME FILE ON 2026-08-31 — a FOURTH time, THIRD
in `wifi.c`, with the rule already written above.** The static-IP feature (#307)
added `static_ip_wanted()`, which called `settings_load_all()` — a whole
**multi-kilobyte `qmx_settings_t`** — and called it from the WiFi/IP event
handlers, i.e. on `sys_evt`'s 2808 bytes. Stack protection fault at **8.283 s of
every boot**, the moment WiFi came up: a boot loop, reported from the bench as
"cyan screen twice looping". Fixed by `settings_get_wifi_static()`, which copies
the four address strings and **nothing else** — 64 bytes.

**Two things to take from the repeat, because the rule alone plainly is not
enough:**
- ⭐ **The struct is the trap, not just arrays.** Every earlier instance was a
  visible `type name[N]`, so `settings_load_all(&st)` does not *look* like a big
  local at the call site — the size is off in a header. **Treat any
  `settings_load_all()` as a multi-kilobyte stack allocation** and check the task
  before writing one. There is already a precedent to copy:
  `settings_get_cw_tx_offset_hz()` and `settings_wifi_known_count()` exist for
  exactly this, and both headers cite this section.
- ⭐ **`wifi.c` is where this keeps happening**, because event handlers look like
  ordinary functions and nothing at the call site says which task they are on.
  Anything new inside `on_wifi_event`/`on_ip_event` gets a narrow accessor, never
  the whole struct.

⭐ **The crash record (#117) made this a five-minute diagnosis** — it named the
task, the core and 8.283 s of uptime on the very next boot, so nothing had to be
reproduced and no backtrace had to be decoded. This is what that feature is for.

**Before adding a local bigger than a couple of hundred bytes, identify which task the code runs on.** Event handlers (`on_wifi_event`, `on_ip_event`) run on `sys_evt`; the settings flush has its own 3 KB task; LVGL callbacks and `lv_timer` callbacks run on taskLVGL. Then pick: a **count-only accessor** if you only need a number (`settings_wifi_known_count()` exists precisely for this), a **file-local `static`** when the callers are single-threaded on one task (the pattern `wifi.c`'s `static wifi_ap_record_t recs[]` already used), or **PSRAM** via `heap_caps_malloc(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)` for anything genuinely large or shared. Never the stack. A stack-protection fault names the task and prints its bounds — that line is the fastest way to confirm which one you hit.

### Audit every `malloc()` under ~16 KB on a hot/recurring path — it's silently going to internal RAM
`CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL=16384`: any plain `malloc()`/`calloc()` smaller than 16 KB is forced onto internal SRAM regardless of free PSRAM, because IDF assumes small allocations are DMA/latency-sensitive. Internal RAM is the one truly scarce resource on this device (see the `esp_hosted`/USB-DWC/LVGL-pool fixes above), so a small allocation on a *frequent* path is just as dangerous as one big allocation — it doesn't show up in a one-time heap budget review, only under load. Two confirmed instances (v0.19.2): `config_io_export()`'s 8 KB INI-text buffer in `storage/config_io.c` (one-shot, on config download) and `ft8_find_clear_tone_hz_near()`/`ft8_tx_is_clashing()`'s ~11 KB `ft8_call_t` snapshot buffer in `ft8_tx.c` — the latter far worse, since `ft8_tx_is_clashing()` runs from a **1-second LVGL timer** (`t_clock_cb` in `ui/ft8_screen_view.c`) whenever a TX is armed/active. Both were caught only after a serial-log-confirmed WiFi-co-processor death under load (internal heap measured as low as 6 KB free / 3 KB largest block); both fixed by switching to `heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT)` (plain `free()` still works on heap_caps allocations, no caller changes needed). If WiFi instability resurfaces, grep for `= malloc(` / `= calloc(` across `main/` first, not just the usual big-buffer suspects — anything under 16 KB that runs on a timer, a poll loop, or per-decode is a candidate.

### FreeRTOS task stacks → PSRAM via `util/psram_task.h` (v0.19.2)
Every `xTaskCreate`/`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` call allocates its stack from internal RAM by default — same scarce resource as the heap above, and there were 7 background tasks doing it for no reason (none of them DMA- or latency-sensitive): `sd_archive` (6144 B), `settings_flush` (3072 B), `time_sync` (3072 B), `diag_persist` (4096 B), `status` (4096 B), `wifi` (4096 B), `wifi_scan` (4096 B) — ~28 KB of internal RAM tied up in idle/low-frequency task stacks. `psram_task_create()` (`main/util/psram_task.c`) wraps `xTaskCreateStaticPinnedToCore()` with the stack buffer in PSRAM (`heap_caps_malloc(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)`) and only the small `StaticTask_t` TCB (~100 B) kept internal as FreeRTOS requires; falls back to a normal internal-stack task if either allocation fails. Gated on `CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_STACK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY=y` (already enabled). All 7 tasks above converted. **Do not use this for `audio_task`, `fft_task`, `render_task`, `cat`'s link/poll tasks, or `ws_push_task`** — those are latency-critical, touch USB/DMA buffers, or are both; PSRAM access is slower than internal SRAM and their margins are already tight. Measured result: idle internal heap baseline went from ~14 KB free (24 KB historically pre-session) to **30-39 KB free with a 24 KB largest block**, confirmed via a fresh-boot serial capture with normal WiFi+FT8+QMX operation and a config download — no `rpc_core` timeout escalation, just the normal handful of transient self-recovering ones. If a future background/non-realtime task is added, use `psram_task_create()` instead of `xTaskCreate` by default.

### LVGL software rotation (~50% FPS cost)
The display panel is natively portrait; landscape is achieved via `lv_display_set_rotation(disp, LV_DISPLAY_ROTATION_90)`. Every LVGL flush goes through `rotate90_rgb565`. FPS is ~13 landscape vs ~22 portrait. Acceptable for a panadapter.

**Do not enable `CONFIG_LVGL_PORT_ENABLE_PPA=y`.** The PPA driver and the USB host stack (UAC + CDC-ACM) compete for DW-GDMA channels. Enabling PPA silently kills QMX connectivity — audio and CAT both stop. Tested and confirmed broken.

### ⛔ PHASE 6.3 (the "native-portrait rewrite") IS DEAD. Do not start it.

This section used to say FPS recovery "requires a full native-portrait UI
rewrite: LVGL configured as 720×1280, all widget positions transposed". That
plan is **wrong twice over**, both established on 2026-08-28. It would have cost
weeks to arrive at either discovery, so it is recorded here rather than in a
TODO row.

**1. Transposing coordinates cannot work, because TEXT cannot be transposed.**
`lv_draw_label.c:339` advances the pen with `pos.x += letter_w + letter_space`
— along **x only**; y moves solely on a line break. `LV_TEXT_FLAG_*` has no
vertical mode and LVGL 9.2 has no vertical-text support at all. With the display
declared 720×1280 and the panel physically landscape on the desk, LVGL's x-axis
runs *vertically* in front of the operator, so every label — the frequency
readout, every decode row, the whole UI — would render **sideways**. Positions
and sizes are a coordinate swap; glyph layout is not. (Pre-rotated glyph
bitmaps do not help: the pen still advances along x. Per-label
`transform_rotation` is the thing that already hung taskLVGL once.)

⚠ **"Native portrait" was also a bad name** and confused the operator, fairly:
nothing turns. The screen stays landscape on the desk. It referred only to the
panel's scan order (720 wide × 1280 tall, mounted with its long axis across the
desk). Call it "native scan order" or "no-rotate UI" if it ever comes up again.

**2. The prize is only ~7 points of core 0, which would not have justified it.**
Measured by neutering `rotate90_rgb565` in `managed_components` so the screen
showed garbage while widget drawing, invalidation, flush count and DSI transfer
sizes stayed byte-identical — i.e. isolating exactly what 6.3 deletes:

| panadapter, radio streaming | core-0 idle |
|---|---|
| with software rotation | 6.9–7.6 % |
| **rotation removed entirely** | **14.3–15.4 %** |

Scope for comparison: `main/ui/` is 32,350 lines, `ui.c` alone 11,458, with 883
coordinate call sites. Seven points of one core is not worth that.

### ⭐ What core 0 is ACTUALLY doing: taskLVGL is 73.9 % of it, and only ~7 of
### those points are the rotation

The panadapter has sat at 0–7 % core-0 idle for months, and this file called it
"unexplained" (v1.8.3 note). Measured on demand with
`/api/cmd {"action":"cpu_owners"}` (per-task `ulRunTimeCounter` over 1 s;
`CONFIG_FREERTOS_GENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS` was already on):

```
taskLVGL  73.9%  core 0      render      8.6%  core 0
IDLE1     89.6%  core 1      audio_task  6.9%  core 0
fft_task   8.4%  core 1      IDLE0       6.7%  core 0
```
Core 0 accounts to 99.2 %, core 1 to 98.6 % — the columns close, so the figures
are trustworthy. Each number is a share of ONE core; the whole table sums to
~200 % because there are two.

**So ~66 points of core 0 is LVGL DRAWING, not rotating**, and everything else
on that core is small change (all USB together is 2.4 %). Generalise the
consequence, because it reframes every "we are out of resources" question on
this board: **PSRAM has ~15 MB free, flash 758 KB, MALLOC_CAP_DMA is
reclaimable, and CORE 1 IS 90 % IDLE.** Nothing is blocked by resources. New
work — a CW page, CW audio, a decoder — belongs on **core 1, at a priority
BELOW `fft_task`**, and nothing new may be put on core 0.

⚠ **Unconfirmed hypothesis for the 66 points, flagged as such:** the waterfall
is a 1280×824 canvas in PSRAM whose *view offset* moves every tick (the
double-height scroll trick), so LVGL may be re-blitting the whole visible
1280×370 into the draw buffer every frame — 947 KB/frame, ~12 MB/s at 13 fps —
with the spectrum canvas on top. If so the fix is not redrawing 947 KB to add
one row, and it is not a rewrite. **Settle it by measurement** (hide each canvas
independently and re-sample `cpu_owners`) before acting on it.

⛔ **Three fixes for core 0 were tried on hardware the same day and ALL FAILED.
Do not re-take them** — each cost a QMX power cycle:
- **Shrinking the rotation working set** (`display.c` `buffer_size` 36 → 12
  lines) made it **worse**, 0.4–1.5 % → 0.0 %. Tripling the flush count cost
  more than the cache residency bought.
- **Moving taskLVGL to core 1** (`.task_affinity` 0 → 1) **broke the device**:
  `fft_task` shares core 1 at the same base priority and is the audio ring's
  only consumer, so within seconds the log read `RX 47766 pairs/s ...
  DROPPED=48000 (ring full)` every second — USB perfect, 0 badpkt, every sample
  discarded. WiFi went too. That is #51 by another route. Any retry must fix
  `fft_task`'s scheduling first, or move the rotation off the LVGL task rather
  than the task off the core.
- **Halving the L2 cache** — see the DMA-pool section; it buys 128 KB of
  DMA-capable RAM and costs core 0 its remaining headroom.
The reasoning for each is in the comments at the relevant lines in
`main/display/display.c` and `sdkconfig.defaults`.

### ⭐ The panadapter's load, ACCOUNTED FOR: 10 Hz x a full-canvas invalidate
`render.c`'s `RENDER_PERIOD_MS` is **100**, so the render task pushes one
waterfall row 10 times a second - and `ui_push_waterfall_row()` ends with
`lv_canvas_set_buffer()`, which **invalidates the whole object** (lv_canvas.c).
So the entire 1280x370 waterfall is redrawn ten times a second in order to add
one row, and the spectrum canvas the same when it has new data.

The arithmetic and the instrument agree, which is what makes this solid rather
than another theory:

| | predicted | measured (`inval kpx/s`, radio OFF) |
|---|---|---|
| waterfall only, 10 Hz x 1280x370 | 4.74 Mpx/s | **4.7-4.9 Mpx/s** |
| + spectrum, 10 Hz x 1280x200 (radio ON) | ~7.3 Mpx/s | not yet measured |

With the radio off the spectrum canvas never invalidates (no new DSP data), which
is exactly why the measured figure lands on the waterfall term alone. `fps` reads
~28 because small widgets (the clock, the spot lane) refresh in between; the
EXPENSIVE invalidations happen 10x/s. **So fps alone is useless as a load metric
on this device** - `idle0`, `fps` and `inval kpx/s` are all three in the periodic
line for that reason.

⛔ **BUT THE COST PER PIXEL IS NOT YET ESTABLISHED, and neither is any fix.**
Measured 2026-08-28 with the radio off, core-0 idle swings **47-57%** at a
constant ~4.7 Mpx/s, purely on background activity - BLE scanning comes in bursts
(`nimble_host` was 6.6% of core 0 in one sample and absent from the next) and the
RBN/DX feeds add more. That noise band swallowed a whole experiment: putting the
LVGL draw buffers in internal RAM instead of PSRAM measured 49-51% against
57-58%, and **that difference is INSIDE the noise, so it proves nothing either
way.** It is retracted rather than recorded.

⚠ **So before the next attempt on this, fix the MEASUREMENT first**: quiesce BLE
and the feeds, take many samples per configuration, and normalise by
`inval kpx/s` rather than comparing raw idle figures. An effect smaller than
10 points of core 0 cannot currently be seen at all.

⚠ **Untested idea worth keeping, explicitly a hypothesis:** on the ESP32-P4 the
L2 cache and the L2MEM heap are the SAME physical SRAM (`memory_layout.c` sizes
the heap region as `SOC_DRAM_HIGH - CONFIG_CACHE_L2_CACHE_SIZE - ...`). If that
means data placed in "fast internal RAM" is no faster than PSRAM behind a large
cache - and costs cache to hold - it would explain both the L2-cache result and
the draw-buffer result with one mechanism. It would also mean **this board's
internal RAM is valuable for DMA reach, not for speed.** Nothing here tests that.

⛔ **The draw-buffer location is runtime-selectable and DEFAULTS TO PSRAM:**
`{"action":"gfx_exp","internal":true,"lines":16}` stores the choice in the
`devgfx` NVS namespace and reboots. Its pre-flight guard requires **200 KB** of
`MALLOC_CAP_DMA` free, and the first version requiring 48 KB **took the device
off the network**: it checked the pool at `display_init()` (~174 KB free) without
budgeting for WiFi's ~111 KB and the SD mount's ~26 KB later in the same boot.
The log read `int free=6KB (min=0KB lblk=2KB LOW!)` while LVGL carried on at 27.9
fps - a unit that looks perfect on its own screen and cannot be reached.
**A guard on a resource that has not finished being spent must budget for the
spending still to come.**

⚠ **PPA is the only untried hardware path left** and it was ruled out for a
GDMA *channel-allocation* conflict with the USB host, not for an inability. If
core-0 headroom is ever needed badly, re-examine it on the channel counts
rather than treating the old verdict as final.

### Hardware revision detection — ST7121 vs ST7123 touch controller
Newer Tab5 units ship with an **ST7121** touch controller (I2C 0x55, FW version = 1) instead of the original **ST7123** (same address, FW version = 3). Both also differ from the older ST7703/GT911 hardware.

Detection lives in `bsp_detect_display_type()` in `components/m5stack_tab5/m5stack_tab5.c`. It probes I2C on startup, reads register 0x0000 from 0x55, and returns `BSP_DISPLAY_TYPE_ST7121` or `BSP_DISPLAY_TYPE_ST7123` accordingly. The result is cached in `s_detected_display_type` — do not call the function more than once per boot (the second call used to re-probe the touch chip after the 800 ms DISPON delay, leaving the bus dirty).

**I2C speed for ST7121/ST7123 touch must be 100 kHz.** The detection probe uses 100 kHz; `bsp_display_indev_init_to_st7123()` must also use 100 kHz (`tp_io_config.scl_speed_hz = 100000`). Do not change this to `CONFIG_BSP_I2C_CLK_SPEED_HZ` (400 kHz) — ST7121 does not respond reliably at 400 kHz.

**ST7121 has an incomplete register map.** The `read_fw_info()` function in `esp_lcd_touch_st7123.c` originally called `ESP_RETURN_ON_ERROR` for all three register reads (`FW_REVISION_REG 0x000C`, `MAX_X_COORD_H_REG 0x0005`). ST7121 NACKs both — this alone would cause `esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_st7123()` to return an error, `bsp_display_start_with_config()` to return NULL, `ESP_ERROR_CHECK(display_init())` to abort, and an immediate panic → reboot **before any UI renders**. v0.13.1 forked the component to `components/espressif__esp_lcd_touch_st7123/`, making only `FW_VERSION_REG (0x0000)` mandatory (others LOGW on failure) and clamping `max_touches > 10` in `read_data()` to prevent a stack smash.

Both ST7121 and ST7123 use the same touch driver (`esp_lcd_touch_new_i2c_st7123`) and the same init path (`bsp_display_indev_init_to_st7123`). The ST7121 and ST7123 LCD panels use separate init sequences (`bsp_display_new_with_handles_to_st7121` / `_to_st7123`) with different DSI lane bitrates (1300 Mbps vs 965 Mbps).

### New-Tab5 boot-loop — RESOLVED (v0.15.0): it was WiFi, not touch
The endless reboot reported on new ST7121 units was **never a display/touch problem**. The GUI rendered fully, then the device reset ~2.5 s later. v0.12.1 (I2C speed) and v0.13.1 (touch register-map tolerance) were shots in the dark without a serial log and fixed nothing — that unit's ST7121 reads every register fine.

The serial log (captured via `tools/capture_serial_log.ps1` — see below) showed the real crash: `assert failed: netif_add ... netif.c:420 (netif already added)`, firing in the background `wifi_task` after `app_main` returns. Root cause: on newer ESP-Hosted/C6 firmware the hosted layer **auto-creates** the default `WIFI_STA_DEF` netif and registers the default STA handlers once the C6 link comes up; `wifi_task` then called `esp_netif_create_default_wifi_sta()` again, registering a **second** copy of `wifi_default_action_sta_start`. One `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START` ran the start action twice, and `esp_netif_start_api()` has no double-add guard → second `netif_add()` → `LWIP_ASSERT` → panic loop. Older C6 firmware doesn't auto-create, so the dev bench (single registration) never reproduced it.

The first fix attempts (v0.16.1, v0.16.2) only partly worked and the diagnosis above was incomplete. They (1) reused `WIFI_STA_DEF` if it already existed, and (2) skipped `esp_wifi_start()` with no SSID. That stopped the *boot* crash on credentialled units, but a second serial log (Roy, v0.17.0, **2026-06-19**) showed the assert still firing on the **SSID-scan path** of a no-credentials unit, with TWO `STA started` lines before the crash. So the real trigger isn't (only) a duplicate handler *registration* — on this C6 firmware a single `esp_wifi_start()` results in `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START` being delivered **twice**, and IDF's default `esp_netif_action_start` is not idempotent (`esp_netif_lwip.c` calls `netif_add()` unconditionally, no double-add guard), so the second delivery adds the same netif twice → assert. Also note: on Roy's unit ESP-Hosted does **not** auto-create `WIFI_STA_DEF` even seconds after the link is up, so the v0.16.1 "reuse" branch never fires there.

**Real fix (v0.17.1, `main/wifi/wifi.c`):** stop installing IDF's default, un-guarded STA handlers entirely. `ensure_sta_netif()` creates the netif with `esp_netif_new()` + `esp_netif_attach_wifi_station()` (no `esp_netif_create_default_wifi_sta()`), and `on_wifi_event()` / `on_ip_event()` drive the netif lifecycle themselves, guarded by `s_netif_started` so a duplicate `STA_START` is a harmless no-op instead of a second `netif_add()`. Crucially these handlers **replicate the hosted RX-callback glue** the default handlers do — `manual_netif_start()` (rxcb if `esp_wifi_is_if_ready_when_started`, netstack buf cb, MAC, `esp_netif_action_start`) and the `STA_CONNECTED` branch's `esp_wifi_register_if_rxcb(..., esp_netif_receive, ...)` for the hosted/`esp_wifi_remote` case (interface not ready at start → rxcb registers on connect). A first attempt that created the netif manually but **omitted** that connect-time rxcb registration built clean and "connected" but the data path was dead (connect issued, no `STA_CONNECTED`/IP ever returned) — the rxcb glue is what makes traffic flow, confirmed by the `esp_wifi_remote: esp_wifi_internal_reg_rxcb: sta:` log on a working connect. Verified on the dev bench (old C6 fw): manual guarded path is taken, connects, gets IP, SNTP, web server. The duplicate-`STA_START` tolerance itself can't be reproduced on the bench; the guard is the cover for it.

**Diagnostic tooling** (kept for future remote debugging, attached to releases):
- `tools/capture_serial_log.ps1` — no-install PowerShell script (.NET `SerialPort`), logs USB console output across reboot cycles to a timestamped `.txt`, with auto-reconnect. Deliberately does **not** set `DtrEnable`/`RtsEnable` — the ESP32-P4 USB-Serial/JTAG auto-reset-to-bootloader circuit watches those lines; asserting them can drop the chip into the ROM download stub with no output.
- `docs/serial-log-howto.md` / `.pdf` — end-user step-by-step guide.
- Decode a panic backtrace with `riscv32-esp-elf-addr2line -e build/qmx_panadapter.elf <addr> ...` — but note `build/` must match the flashed commit (the embedded SHA differs only by compile timestamp; code addresses match if same commit + same pinned IDF).

The v0.13.1 touch-driver fork (register-map tolerance, `max_touches` clamp) is harmless and kept as defensive cover for ST7121 units that *do* have an incomplete register map.

### `MALLOC_CAP_DMA` is the pool that runs out after WiFi — NOT the internal heap (2026-07-26)
Measured on hardware, four boots, SD-enabled vs `SD_ARCHIVE_DISABLED` A/B, 230 s serial capture each. The **DMA-capable pool collapses during WiFi bring-up and never recovers**: 112 KB free / 77 KB largest block at 4.2 s → **703 B at 14 s → flat ~379–399 B from 44 s onward**. WiFi consumes ~111 KB of it. Meanwhile the *general* internal heap stays perfectly healthy throughout — 35–40 KB free with a **31 KB largest block**.

**This is why every previous "internal heap starvation" theory in this file was correctly rejected**: internal free/largest-block genuinely is fine. The exhausted pool is `MALLOC_CAP_DMA`, which nothing was measuring. With ~400 B left, **any runtime DMA allocation should be expected to fail** — the SD remount failures (`0x101 ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`) are one symptom, and the long-documented USB endpoint-alloc failure on a QMX reconnect once WiFi is up is very likely the same root constraint rather than a separate bug. Both standing esp_hosted patches (PSRAM transport, SDIO recovery) were verified applied, so they are **not** the consumer; the ~111 KB is something else and is NOT yet identified.

**⚠ ROOT-CAUSED 2026-08-05 — the missing consumer was OUR OWN `.bss`, not WiFi.** The "~111 KB consumed by WiFi ... NOT yet identified" conclusion above was wrong. `idf.py size` showed `.bss` at 201 KB (45% of DIRAM), `idf.py size-components` put **186,986 B of it in `libmain.a`**, and `nm --size-sort -S` named the arrays: `s_worked` (22.5 KB ADIF worked-call cache), two `static ft8_call_t snap[]` heard-table snapshots (11.25 KB each), `s_rows` (8 KB row-widget pool). Moving those three to PSRAM recovered **52 KB** and took `MALLOC_CAP_DMA` from ~311 B to **40–41 KB with WiFi fully up** — measured, IP acquired, POTA fetching. So our static arrays occupied the DMA-capable region and WiFi's (real) share was merely the last straw. Steady internal free went 22–24 KB → 78 KB and the **watermark 0 KB → 32 KB**; the watermark reaching zero is why any runtime allocation was a coin toss. This reframes the whole #65 family — SD remount `0x101`, USB EP alloc on QMX reconnect, and the device-wide TLS failure (hardware AES could not get DMA descriptors) — as ONE root cause. **Deliberately still internal:** `audio.c`'s `raw[]`/`decoded[]` and the `dsp.c` FFT buffers (~53 KB) — hot paths, and v0.19.4 already proved a PSRAM spill makes the STFT ~10x slower. **Method lesson: `size` → `size-components` → `nm` is the three-command answer to "who owns internal RAM"; it took minutes and had never been run.**

### ⭐ Why "internal free 35–40 KB" and "DMA free 400 B" were both true (2026-08-28)
This file has carried that contradiction for a year. `heap/port/esp32p4/memory_layout.c`
resolves it: the internal heap is **not one pool**. Two L2MEM regions carry
`MALLOC_CAP_DMA` (`RETENT_RAM` + the startup-data region), and two more do
**not** — **TCM, 8 KB @0x30100000** and **LPRAM, 32 KB @0x50108000**, which match
`MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL` only at medium/low priority. So a plain
`MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL|8BIT` request goes to L2MEM first and **spills into
TCM/LPRAM once L2MEM is full** — which is exactly what "35–40 KB internal free"
was: ~40 KB of non-DMA memory that cannot serve FatFs, USB endpoints or SDIO.
Caught directly: `nimble_host`'s stack sat at `0x5010c4d4` (LPRAM) on one boot
and moved back into the DMA region on the next once space existed.

⚠ **Consequence for any reclamation pass:** freeing DMA-capable bytes does not
raise `dma free` one-for-one, because allocations that had spilled to LPRAM move
back in. Judge a reclamation by **total demand**, never by the free figure alone.

### ⭐ The DMA pool is mostly TASK STACKS — and the way to prove it is pxStackBase
`util/dma_owners.c` (#283/#284) matches every block address against each live
task's `TaskStatus_t.pxStackBase` and `xHandle`, so a block is named "STACK of
X" or "TCB of X" instead of merely "allocated by whoever called xTaskCreate".
That distinction is the whole point: `xTaskCreate()` takes the stack from the
**caller's** context, so every stack created during `app_main()` is filed under a
handle that no longer resolves. Measured: **24 of the top 34 blocks, 115 KB, are
task stacks.**

⚠ **Match by CONTAINMENT, not equality.** `CONFIG_HEAP_TASK_TRACKING` stores the
owning-task handle in the block's first word and hands the caller back
`address+4`, so a stack pointer can never *equal* a block address on a tracking
build. The first version compared for equality, reported no stacks at all, and
read exactly like "none of these are stacks" — which would have sent the whole
pass down a blind alley. Bound the offset too (≤256 B): plain containment let one
32,772 B block claim to be the stack of every task at a higher address.

⛔ **`esp_hosted` hardcodes its task stacks and IGNORES its own Kconfig.**
`host/port/include/os_wrapper.h` sets `DFLT_TASK_STACK_SIZE` and
`RPC_TASK_STACK_SIZE` to `(5*1024)` literally, while `sdkconfig` carries
`CONFIG_ESP_HOSTED_DFLT_TASK_STACK=3072` doing nothing. That is the 6 × 5,376 B
of DMA pool held by `sdio_rx_buf`/`sdio_read`/`sdio_process_rx`/`sdio_write`/
`rpc_rx`/`rpc_tx`, whose measured peaks are 716–3,044 B.
**DONE 2026-09-11 (`apply_esp_hosted_task_stacks.ps1`, patch #17)** after a
boot that started with the DMA pool at 99 B crashed at 24 min: `sdio_rx_buf` and
`sdio_write` → 3,072, `sdio_process_rx` → 4,096, `sdio_read` unchanged, and the
RPC pair moved to **PSRAM** (`xTaskCreateWithCaps`, deleted with
`vTaskDeleteWithCaps`). ~15 KB leaves the pool; measured +4.5 KB `dma free` and
+8 KB internal against the last healthy boot - less than 15 because freed
internal RAM is partly re-taken by allocations that had spilled (see above).
The `stacks` dev action now prints `PSRAM`/`int` per stack, which is how the
move was verified - heap task tracking is not compiled in.

### ⭐ The L2 CACHE is carved out of the DMA-capable heap — 128 KB is one Kconfig line
`CONFIG_CACHE_L2_CACHE_256KB` vs `_128KB`. `memory_layout.c` sizes the heap
region as `SOC_DRAM_HIGH - CONFIG_CACHE_L2_CACHE_SIZE - ...`, and the observed
heap top was exactly `0x4ffc0000 - 256 KB = 0x4ff80000`. Switching to 128 KB
returns **exactly 128 KB** to `MALLOC_CAP_DMA` — measured: `dma free` 10,071 B →
~101,000 B, internal free 39 KB (min **2 KB**) → 144 KB (min 68 KB).

⛔ **And it was reverted, because it is not free.** `SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS`,
`SPIRAM_RODATA` and `SPIRAM_XIP_FROM_PSRAM` are all on, so code and rodata are
fetched through that cache. Panadapter core-0 idle collapsed 6.9–7.6 % → 0.1–1.5 %
with a visibly jerky waterfall; FT8 `dec` went 3018 → 3149 ms (+4.3 %), which does
not matter, but the waterfall does. Two attempts to buy the headroom back were
falsified the same day — see the Phase 6.3 section. **Revisit only if core 0 ever
gets headroom.**

⚠ **Size a stack from the path that runs when the hardware is ABSENT.**
`tab5_kb` was cut 4096 → 2048 on a measured 1,008 B peak and the next reading came
back at **52 bytes** of high-water, then crashed the device at 18 minutes
(`Stack protection fault`, task `tab5_kb`, caught by #117's crash record). The
1,008 B was measured with a keyboard attached; the deep path is the ABSENT one —
the 2 s retry loop plus the I2C bus scan, ~2,124 B — and that is what runs on a
bench with no keyboard. Generalise it: a high-water mark is only evidence about
the paths that actually ran.

⚠ **The SD symptom is NOT this pool.** Corrected on the day: with the card
mounted and then failing, the log reads `SDFAIL[slowopen] err=0x5` — **errno 5,
EIO** — with **135 KB of DMA free and a 65 KB largest block**. That is the
documented WiFi/GDMA contention in the SD section, where the EIO is recorded as
permanent, not a memory failure. Do not credit a successful mount to memory
headroom either; `0x108` at mount time is intermittent.

**Rule:** when a runtime allocation fails on this board, measure `heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)` and `heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)`, not the INTERNAL pool. `get_free_size` is O(1) and safe on a periodic path (a `dma free=` field is now in the periodic `audio: HEAP` line); `largest_free_block` walks the heap with interrupts off and must stay off periodic paths (cyan-flash rule below) — it appears only on the rare SD failure path, capped at 3 calls (`SDFAIL[...]` lines in `sd_archive.c`).

### WiFi kills a mounted SD card — the card is fine (2026-07-26)
The discriminating experiment CLAUDE.md had wanted since 2026-07-06, finally run in the inverse direction (no WiFi rather than no SD): with `panadapter_wifi_start()` never called, the **same** card mounted on the FIRST attempt at 4.132 s, mirrored all files, and stayed mounted for the full 230 s — 7 heartbeats, ~70 write bursts, max 6–15 ms, **zero failures**. With WiFi on, across five boots: mount fails intermittently with `0x108 ESP_ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE` and, once mounted, the card dies within 10–140 s and can never be remounted. Supports this file's long-standing candidate **(a): GDMA/bus contention between the SPI2 SD path and the WiFi SDIO path.** The first mount at ~4.1 s races esp_hosted bring-up, which is why it is intermittent.

**Three wrong causal stories were adopted and retracted in that one session — all from over-reading a single observation.** Recorded so they are not re-adopted: (1) "dies 226 ms after the IP" — coincidence; deaths were at 13.6 s / 58.7 s / 140 s, plus one boot that never mounted, with the IP always at 12.4–13.4 s, so there is **no** timing correlation. (2) "the card is faulty" — over-corrected from a single `0x108`-with-free-memory; falsified by the no-WiFi run. (3) heap starvation — see the `MALLOC_CAP_DMA` note above. **Run the controlled experiment before forming the causal story.**

**Shipped mitigations, each with its measured result:** boot-window mount retries (5 × 150 ms, inside the window where DMA memory still exists) **work** — attempts 1–2 failed `0x108`, attempt 3 mounted and mirrored everything. Write-retry on the still-open handle does **NOT** rescue a session (the `EIO` is permanent, not transient) but is kept as cheap insurance, and needs `clearerr()` or the retry never reaches the card. SD SPI 20→10 MHz had **no effect** on `0x108`. `park_snapshot()` stops background mirroring but deliberately **keeps the card MOUNTED** — unmounting would make the Reader/`/files`/log-download all report "no card" with a card inserted, and a remount is impossible once WiFi is up. Deliberate parking also removes a real corruption path: previously the card was torn down mid-write with the diag log still open, which is how FAT directory entries get damaged.

### ⭐ THE COUNTRY TABLE IS 270 KB, AND IT IS THE FIRST PLACE TO LOOK WHEN FLASH RUNS SHORT

`main/util/geo_coords.c` is generated by `tools/gen_geo_coords.py` from
`tools/geo_coords_source.csv` (Uwe DL8UG's own dataset, 2026-09-18). Both are
committed - the previous table's header named a generator that did not exist,
so 4,169 rows were unreproducible for months.

**18,365 prefixes, ~270 KB of flash**, and the size buys per-REGION resolution:
`3H2A` lands in Harbin rather than at one point for all of China, `UA3XYZ` and
`UA0ABC` separate European from Asiatic Russia. Pruning was measured and cannot
help - **18,356 of the 18,365 carry a coordinate their parent prefix would not
give**, so the size IS the resolution.

⛔ **IF HEADROOM EVER GETS TIGHT AGAIN, THIS IS THE KNOWN ~240 KB.** Operator,
2026-09-19: *"If we later need to shrink again due to small headroom then we
will have to go back to the simpler way."* The simpler way is measured and
specific, so nobody has to rediscover it:

- Only **2,203** of the 18,365 prefixes say anything new about a COUNTRY NAME.
  The other 16,162 exist purely to refine WHERE INSIDE it a station sits
  (Argentina alone has 4,200, European Russia 3,221, Ukraine 2,568).
- A names-only table of those 2,203 is about **27 KB** - i.e. **~240 KB back**,
  and still better country data than the 74 KB table this replaced.
- What is lost is exactly the map's within-country placement: every station in
  China goes back to one dot. Nothing else changes - `country_display()`,
  `country_shorten()` and every caller are unaffected.

The pruning rule is one pass: drop a prefix whose nearest shorter prefix
resolves to the same `(dxcc, iso3, name)`. Add it to the generator rather than
editing the table.

⚠ **Judge the cost against the SMALLEST app slot, not the binary.** v1.15.0 left
`ota_1` at 6.81 MB and the build at 38% free after this table went in. It is not
tight today; this note exists so the decision is informed when it is.

### ⛔ A COUNTRY NAME IS SHORTENED, NEVER REPLACED BY A CODE (reversed 2026-09-19)

`country_display()` used to spell the name out where it fitted and return the
3-letter ISO code where it did not - *"Netherlands" or "NLD", never
"Netherlan"* - and this file, `ft8_screen_view.c` and `wspr_screen_view.c` all
said so. **That rule is gone.** Operator, looking at a column of them: *"I hate
to see those 3 char countries in the list - for me its apples and pears -
please cut them off intelligently."*

He is right about the real fault: a column reading `Sweden / Ireland / NLD /
Italy` makes the reader switch alphabets mid-column. One consistent kind of
answer beats one that is occasionally more precise.

`util/country_shorten.c` (portable, host-tested by
`test/country_shorten_harness.c`) does it in four steps, each cheaper in meaning
than the last: drop a parenthetical, a known short form, generic abbreviations,
then a cut. **Two rules keep the cut readable and both came from READING THE
OUTPUT over all 340 names, not from imagining it:**

- a mid-word cut ends in a **period** - `Netherl.` announces itself, `Netherlan`
  pretends to be a word;
- a word-boundary cut may **not end on a connective**, which is what produced
  `Isle of` and `DPR of` the first time.

⚠ **A column width is now a real decision.** Measured over the whole table:
**10 chars -> 28 names need shortening, 13 -> 6, 16 -> 1, 18 -> 0.** The FT8 and
WSPR lists pass 10; the SelfSpotter LIST passes 18. Run the harness before
changing one.

### The user manual is compiled INTO the firmware — `docs/mkdocs/**` is a build input
`main/manual.bin` (EMBED_FILES, read by `net/manual_embed.c`, packed by `tools/pack_manual.py`) carries the whole manual, ~136 KB of an 8 MB app partition. Deliberately **not** SPIFFS: flashing a build-time SPIFFS image would overwrite the `storage` partition, which holds `qso.adi` and the LoTW certificate **and private key** — the flasher writes only 0x2000/0x8000/0x10000 precisely so user data survives an update. Embedding also guarantees the manual matches the running firmware, which SPIFFS could not.

**Release-ordering trap:** the chapter order comes from `mkdocs.yml`'s nav via `mkdocs_reader_export.py`, which runs the packer during `mkdocs build`. So **docs must be finalised BEFORE the release build**, and `main/manual.bin` committed, or the shipped binary carries the previous manual. Verify from the boot log: `manual: built-in manual: N entries, X KB` (N = nav pages + 1 for toc.json). A stale blob is otherwise invisible until an operator notices an out-of-date contents list.

**The packer also verifies the context-help deep links (v1.5.0)**, parsing `main/ui/help_topics.c` and failing the build if a page or heading it points at has gone — the whole reason that check lives at build time is that rotted deep links are otherwise found by users. It prints `pack_manual: N context-help deep link(s) verified`. Two consequences: **renaming a heading in `docs/mkdocs/**` can break the build** (fix the anchor in `help_topics.c`, or pick a shorter distinctive substring), and `mkdocs_reader_export.py` **raises** on a packer failure rather than warning — a failed pack leaves the previous blob in place, so a warning would have shipped a stale manual invisibly. What the check CANNOT catch is an anchor that still exists but is the wrong heading for the question; that judgement stays human.

**Also a firmware input in practice: heading text.** `help_topics.c` anchors are case-insensitive heading *substrings* chosen to survive renumbering and small rewordings, but they are still a coupling between prose and code. Grep `help_topics.c` before renaming any heading in the docs.

### ⛔ The docs live in TWO trees. README is NOT the single source.

The **PDF** is built from `README.md` (between the `USERGUIDE` markers) **plus four
injected guide files** (`guide/panadapter.md`, `ft8-rx.md`, `ft8-tx.md`,
`time-sync.md`). The **website** and the **on-device manual** are built from
`docs/mkdocs/**` and **never touch README**. Fixing a fact in one tree does not
fix it in the other.

Reading the shipped v1.7.0 PDF (2026-08-09) turned up **~15 wrong statements, all
of them in `docs/mkdocs/**`** and all shipped to the website, the PDF and the
embedded manual: the tune-snap grid described as zoom-based (it is **mode**-based),
the ×1 span called "4 MHz" (it is **48 kHz**), a tappable S-meter peak-hold that
**has never existed**, `settings → About → Reset` and `Settings → Diagnostic log`
(**neither control exists**), and "Factory Reset erases the ADIF log" — the exact
**opposite** of what `factory_reset.c` does. Plus 14 × "new in the next release"
left from the previous cycle. README was right in *every* conflict, because README
is the file that actually gets read.

**`tools/check_docs.py` runs from the mkdocs hook.** Forward-looking phrasing is an
**error that fails the docs build**. Duplicate coverage and PDF-coverage gaps are
warnings, and those counts are the backlog — **if the duplicate count goes UP, a
new second copy was just created.** ⚠ It cannot tell whether two copies *agree*;
that stays human, and is Phase 4.0 of the release process.

**Verify every number and every menu path against the code, never from memory.**
Plan for collapsing the duplicates: `docs/docs-single-source-plan.md`.

⛔ **A PDF chapter needs a `## Title` IN README, or it ships as a TOC line with no
body — and `check_docs.py` cannot see it.** `tools/build_userguide_pdf.ps1` holds
the chapter list, and each entry injects its guide file only where README's
USERGUIDE section already contains a matching `## <Title>` heading. No heading, no
injection — but the TOC is built from the chapter LIST, so the entry still appears
with a page number pointing at nothing.

**Radio menus shipped that way from v1.8.4 to v1.9.6**: nine releases with a
"9. Radio menus" line in the contents and no chapter behind it. WSPR was about to
do the same. Both README anchors were added at v1.10.0 and the guide went **107 ->
116 pages**.

The checker misses it because it reads the **builder's chapter list** to decide
what is "in the PDF" — the same list that is lying. So when a chapter is added to
that list, **grep README for its `## Title` in the same commit**, and verify by
extracting the built PDF's text rather than by reading the TOC:

```bash
pdftotext docs/QMX-Panadapter-UserGuide-vX.Y.Z.pdf - | grep -n "^9\. WSPR"
```

Two hits (TOC and body) is correct; one hit is a chapter that does not exist.


### LVGL hit-tests children in REVERSE CREATION ORDER and ignores siblings — a foregrounded screen child wins over a full-screen overlay (v1.5.0)
The Reader's own **Back / Exit / Contents** buttons could not be tapped at all, and it looked like an overlay z-order bug. It is not: the top-bar Band/Mode/BW **hit zones are direct children of the screen** and are `lv_obj_move_foreground()`ed as a keepalive, so they sit above the Reader overlay in the screen's child list — and LVGL walks a parent's children in reverse creation order, taking the first hit, **without comparing siblings' areas or z-intent**. The BW zone therefore swallowed every touch aimed at the overlay's header. Same root cause produced three siblings of the same bug in one screenshot: panadapter edge-swipe strips staying live over the manual, the QMX-wait prompt's own keepalive re-foregrounding itself over the drawer, and the FT8 drawer reflow stacking on itself (that one from a hardcoded `y` under a comment warning it had to be kept in step by hand).

⛔ **AND THE SAME ORDER DECIDES DRAWING, WHICH COST A SECOND ROUND (2026-09-09).**
Everything above is about who wins a TOUCH, and the remedy — standing the top bar
and the edge strips down — was mistaken for the whole problem. It is not:
`reader_view_show()` only cleared `LV_OBJ_FLAG_HIDDEN` and **never
`lv_obj_move_foreground(s_overlay)`**. The overlay is built once at init, so every
object created or foregrounded afterwards sits above it and is DRAWN over it.
`wspr_screen_view_show()` explicitly foregrounds its own near-full-screen opaque
container, so opening the manual from the WSPR page drew the WSPR page straight
over it — header bar visible, body gone, and the operator looking at a screen that
said "Settings & Configuration" above a WSPR waterfall.

**How it was pinned, because reading the code would not have done it:** three
`/ss.bmp` captures — broken on WSPR, clean on the panadapter, broken again on
WSPR. That alternation is what ruled out the markdown renderer I had just changed
and pointed at foreground order. ⚠ The first two captures of the session were
*fine on WSPR*, so a single observation would have exonerated it. **An overlay has
to raise itself every time it is shown; nothing else should have to stand down for
it.**

**Rules that came out of it.** (1) Anything that re-foregrounds itself on a timer must ALSO stand down — `ui_help_overlay_changed()` is the single notification, and the hide is re-asserted every second so nothing can get stuck hidden. (2) **Hiding the edge strips is the operation, not clearing `LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE`** — the breathing grips are CHILD objects with their own hit areas, and the drawer grip is a separate `s_burger_btn` entirely, so clearing the parent's flag leaves three live targets. (3) `ext_click_area` is clipped to the parent: the Reader's header buttons are children of the OVERLAY, not of the header bar, precisely so their enlarged hit area can reach below the bar.

### ⛔ A per-mode UI state applied at the TRANSITION is not applied on the path that has no transition (v1.12.1)
Two faults, one week apart, in the same five objects — and the second is the one
worth generalising.

**First (`3861717`): two functions both owned `LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE` on the
top-bar hit zones and disagreed, and the 1 Hz one won.**
`top_bar_set_ft8_dim()` was called with `(next != UI_MODE_PANADAPTER)` and
correctly dropped them; `sync_nav_affordances()` tested `(== UI_MODE_FT8)` and
put them back a second later. The Band zone is `x 0..180` and up to 200 px deep,
and v1.12.0 had moved the WSPR band button underneath it — so a tap opened the
**panadapter's** band dropdown and picking from it wrote an FT8 frequency
straight to the radio. Caught with the QMX on 1.840 MHz while WSPR captured and
believed it was on 7.038600. FT8 was only ever safe there by luck: its own
controls happen to sit clear of `x<180` in the top 200 px.

**Second (`59e3622`): the fix was invisible on the bench because the bench
swiped, and the operator's Tab5 REBOOTED into WSPR.**
`ui_apply_saved_mode()`'s WSPR branch never called `top_bar_set_ft8_dim()` — the
FT8 branch below it always had. So a unit that woke on WSPR had a bright, fully
clickable Band/Mode/BW/Zoom, which is how nearly every user would meet the page,
since it is remembered across a power cycle. ⚠ **`sync_nav_affordances()` hid
this at 1 Hz for the ZONES and not for the LABELS**, and the labels carry their
own **90–110 px `ext_click_area` halos**, so every control was still reachable.

**The fix is structural, and it is the rule:** `top_bar_apply_mode()` takes **no
argument**, derives everything from `ui_mode_get()` plus the overlay predicates,
and is called by `sync_nav_affordances()` at 1 Hz — so any path that forgets is
self-healing within a second, and no caller can pass a stale belief. **A UI state
that must hold for a whole mode belongs in something re-derived, not in the three
places that happen to enter that mode.** Count those places before writing the
first one: here there were three, and the boot one was missed.

⚠ Also settled: **greyed now means inert, everywhere**, freq included. It used to
dim four labels and never the fifth, so on FT8 the frequency looked live and was
not — the same broken promise as the mouse pointer's colour.

⚠ **And reading the code was not what found it.** Both functions read correctly
in isolation; a `/ss.bmp` crop of the top bar showed full-brightness labels in
one look. Screenshot the bar.

### `lv_indev_wait_release()` mid-gesture collides with LVGL's OWN scroll-throw animation — a real crash, shipped and fixed in the same cycle (v1.10.8)
v1.10.7's drawer-scroll protection called `lv_indev_wait_release(indev)` from `LV_EVENT_SCROLL_BEGIN`, meaning to freeze every other control the instant LVGL decided a touch belonged to the drawer's own scroll — "so a slider cannot creep, a checkbox cannot toggle, and the close-swipe cannot fire", per its own comment. Reproduced three times: `Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic'ed (Instruction access fault)`, `MEPC=0x00000008`, task `taskLVGL`, always inside `anim_completed_handler` (`lv_anim.c:590`) — an animation's own `completed_cb` corrupted to the literal integer `8`.

**Two hypotheses were tried and FALSIFIED on hardware before the real one.** (1) Pan/pinch gesture interference — a guard was added (`pinch_poll_cb` now also excludes `s_drawer_open`, a real fix kept regardless), and the crash reproduced again with the operator explicitly not panning. (2) Heap corruption visible to IDF's own tooling — `CONFIG_HEAP_POISONING_LIGHT` never fired once. **Neither IDF's heap poisoning nor `lv_mem_test()` (LVGL's own tlsf arena-integrity walk) can see this class of corruption at all**: LVGL takes ONE big block from `heap_caps_malloc` at boot (`main/util/lv_pool_shim.h`) and manages every sub-allocation itself inside it — IDF's per-block canaries wrap only the outer block, and an arena-integrity walk validates the allocator's own free-list bookkeeping, not the CONTENTS of a still-live allocation. A corrupted callback pointer inside one valid, in-use `lv_anim_t` is invisible to both.

**What actually found it: patching the crash site itself to log instead of crash.** `anim_completed_handler`'s `completed_cb`/`deleted_cb` calls were temporarily guarded (`(uintptr_t)cb < 0x1000` → log `var`/`exec_cb`/`custom_exec_cb` instead of calling it) — turning every future occurrence into one clean log line and letting the device survive. Ten hits, all sharing the IDENTICAL `var` and `exec_cb`; `exec_cb` decoded to `lv_obj_get_scroll_y` (`lv_obj_scroll.c:126`) — **LVGL's OWN built-in `scroll_y_anim`**, not anything of ours. That is what `lv_indev_wait_release()` was colliding with: forcing the indev to treat a still-down finger as already released mid-gesture steps on LVGL's own press/release state machine, which is also what drives its momentum-scroll-throw lifecycle on the same object.

**Fix: the call is gone**, full stop — not replaced, not softened. `s_drawer_is_scrolling` (already read by the close-swipe check) is sufficient on its own, and it turns out sliders/checkboxes were never actually exposed by removing the freeze: they already have `LV_OBJ_FLAG_SCROLL_CHAIN_VER` cleared (the v1.3.5 fix, above in this file's "Settings-drawer sliders/checkboxes intermittent" note), so a touch starting on one of them can never chain up into the drawer's own scroll and reach `LV_EVENT_SCROLL_BEGIN` in the first place. Both temporary diagnostics (the `lv_anim.c` guard, a 100 ms `lv_mem_test()` poll timer gated on the drawer being open) were stripped before release — they did their job identifying the cause and left no trace in the shipped binary.

**Generalise it: do not call `lv_indev_wait_release()` (or any other indev-internal-state mutator) from inside an event fired MID-gesture**, only from a point where the gesture has already fully resolved (e.g. `LV_EVENT_RELEASED`/`PRESS_LOST`). LVGL's own gesture/scroll/throw machinery keeps state across the whole press-to-release lifecycle, and short-circuiting part of that lifecycle from the outside is not a supported operation, however good the reason. If a similar need comes up again, reach for a flag other code explicitly checks (the pattern `s_drawer_is_scrolling`/`s_touch_on_bandplan`/`freq_keypad_is_open()` already use throughout this file), not an indev-level override.

### `FW;` reports the filter's TOP EDGE in a digital mode, not its width (v1.8.3)
Samuel W7STF measured a ~250 Hz gap between the dial and the start of the shaded
passband. `compute_passband_edges_hz()` (`ui.c`) hardcoded `low = 200; high = 200 + w`
for USB/LSB **and** digital, and that 200 never came from the radio at all.

Two separate errors, and the second is the interesting one:
- Digital modes do **not** use the selectable SSB filters. The QMX operation manual
  names one fixed filter for them: the *"default 150-3200Hz wide filter used for
  Digital modes"*.
- **In DiGi the radio reports `FW;` = 3200** (measured, 1_04_004). That is the filter's
  **top edge**, not a width — `150 + 3200` would be 3350 and contradict the manual. So
  the CAT number is used as the high corner on that path.

Verified by pixel measurement on `/ss.bmp` (37.5 Hz/px axis, dial cursor at x=641,
tint x=645..727 → +150 to ~+3225 Hz), not by reading the code back.

⚠ **SSB still treats the number as a width, and that is deliberate.** The low corner
for the selectable SSB filters (2500/2700/2900/3200) is not documented anywhere I can
find, so `PB_SSB_LOW_HZ` stays at 200 and is marked UNVERIFIED. Do not "make it
consistent" with the digital figure — that would be a guess wearing evidence's
clothes. Samuel has been asked for the real number.

### ⛔ The FT8 monitor pool can be built TWICE, and the build path used to double-free the shared FFT scratch
Serial-captured 2026-08-19 switching into FT8, and it is almost certainly the
**"one unreproduced `tlsf_free` double-free reboot"** open since v1.3.0 — it now has
a backtrace and a mechanism.

```
ft8_task -> build_monitor_pool (ft8_test.c:535) -> free()
assert failed: tlsf_free ... block already marked as free
```

All `FT8_NUM_BUFFERS` (2) monitors share ONE FFT scratch buffer. The build loop
freed `s_mon_pool[i]->fft_work` **unconditionally** before repointing it, so on a
rebuild that skipped the teardown every monitor still pointed at the OLD shared
buffer and the same block was freed twice. ⚠ **The two TEARDOWN paths already make
exactly this check** (`if (fft_work == s_shared_fft_work) fft_work = NULL;` in
`free_monitor_pool` and `reinit_pool_if_mode_changed`) — only the build path was
missing it, which is the shape to look for when a shared buffer is introduced.

**What made it build twice**, from the log one second earlier:
`W ft8_view: t_clock_cb: FT8 view visible but no ft8_task alive - respawning` — the
respawn watchdog (v0.20.0) raced the normal FT8-entry path. Four `Block size` lines
where one build emits two confirms it.

**Fixed: the REBOOT, not the double build.** The loop frees only a buffer the monitor
owns, and an old shared buffer left unreferenced is **LEAKED once** rather than freed —
a decode may still be reading it on the other core, and a use-after-free would be just
as fatal and harder to find. ⚠ **It logs a LOUD warning** (`monitor pool rebuilt with
no teardown`) precisely so the double build stays visible; a silent survival is how
this stayed open for months. **TODO #199** is the real fix — making the respawn
watchdog and the FT8-entry path agree on who starts `ft8_task`. That is task
lifecycle, where the v0.18.1 double-spawn and v0.19.5 worker-join crashes both live,
so it wants a soak rather than a quick edit. ⚠ **The defensive path has NOT been seen
firing**: 6 FT8-entry cycles and an FT8→FT4 change were all clean, with 2 respawn
events survived — which means the fault did not recur, NOT that the fix is proven.

### ⛔ `httpd_ws_send_frame_async()` reports a PARTIAL WRITE as success — never use it for the stream
Samuel W7STF's "the web panadapter hangs for seconds, and it is worse every
release" (#193, v1.8.7). Root-caused by MEASURING a 9.6 h capture first, not by
reading code: **545 session teardowns**, median 14.4 s apart, each costing the
browser a **median 2.2 s (p90 4.5 s)** blackout while it reconnected — while the
stream ran at a healthy 10.0 fps in between. Feed activity was enriched in the 2 s
before a teardown (RBN 8.4x, DX cluster 8.6x, TLS 5.7x, SDIO recovery 4.6x) against
an 8.1 % base rate. **Socket exhaustion was TESTED AND FALSIFIED** (0 accept/ENFILE
errors) — do not go looking there again.

**The fault is in IDF, verified by reading the pinned v5.4.4 source.**
`httpd_ws_send_frame_async()` sends the header and the payload with two bare
`sess->send_fn()` calls and checks only `< 0`. `httpd_default_send()` is a single
`send()` returning a BYTE COUNT, so a short count is not negative and **a partial
TCP write is reported as `ESP_OK`**. The ordinary HTTP path is fine — it uses
`httpd_send_all()`, which loops. The WS path never got that loop.

⚠ **The freeze fix and this bug are the same line.** `ws_uri_handler()` sets
`SO_SNDTIMEO` to 400 ms so a stuck send cannot freeze the single httpd worker (the
2026-07-14 fix), and a send timeout on a socket with bytes already queued is
precisely how a short count arises. So on a congested link the partial write is the
EXPECTED outcome, not an edge case.

The result is not a dropped frame but a **corrupt stream**: the browser is told to
expect `WS_FRAME_LEN` payload bytes, gets fewer, and consumes the next frame's
header as this frame's tail — every later frame misparses until it sees a protocol
violation and closes the socket. Hence "freezes for a few seconds and comes back"
rather than one glitchy frame, and hence "worse every release": feeds have been
ADDED over time, so there is more congestion to trigger it.

Fixed entirely in our own code — **no 9th standing IDF patch**, since
`httpd_socket_send()` is public and returns the byte count. `ws_send_all()` loops
until every byte is out; the WS header is built in front of the payload so the two
cannot be split; **a frame we are committed to mid-way must be finished or the
session closed, because abandoning it IS the corruption**; EAGAIN with nothing sent
is free to drop, since the stream is still in sync. `HTTPD_SOCK_ERR_INVALID` means
httpd already removed the session, so it closes immediately instead of burning 15
attempts (~800 ms) on a socket that no longer exists.

**Counted, not silent:** `partial writes healed` on the fps line. Before the fix
these were indistinguishable from healthy sends, the same unverifiability trap #189
documents for the USB patches. Hardware-verified: 9.3 min under live feed load gave
**0 teardowns, 0 ECONNRESET, 8 partial writes healed**.

### dBm gridlines are DERIVED from the dB range, and the arithmetic is host-tested
`s_grid_dbm[]` was a hardcoded `{ -40, -60, -80, -100, -120 }`, which silently assumed
the default −130..−30 range: at Samuel's −118/−13 the labels described a scale that was
not there. `util/db_gridlines.c` now picks the smallest round step that still fits in
`DB_SCALE_MAX_LBLS` lines, so a narrow range gets FINER lines rather than fewer.

It is a separate portable file **so `test/db_gridlines_harness.c` can link the real
function**, and that paid twice on the day it was written: the harness caught a wrong
expectation of mine, and a mutation run showed that **no test reached the case where
the `n > max_n` clamp is the only thing preventing a write past the caller's
five-element array**. All four mutations are caught now. The harness also pins the
default range to the exact old five values — this fix must be invisible to anyone who
never touched the sliders.

### ⛔ THE BAND-PLAN KNOB IS THE WINDOW - A DRAG PANS, A TAP TUNES (v1.14.5)
The knob is drawn as a frame around the visible span precisely so it reads as a
grab-and-slide handle, and until now a drag of it wrote the **dial**. The still
display (#298) then faithfully held the view, so the box sprang back to where it
started and left the marker and passband at whichever edge of it the new dial
fell on. Operator, 2026-09-18: *"it does not stop where i left it but bounces off
that position ... i would expect the slider comprising the visible spectrum +
freq and BW to move together"*, then, when it was fixed as a re-frame-on-tune:
*"I want the box (spectrum) always to follow and stay where i drag it to - no
matter a little or a big jump. Dial + BW can stay on freq as long as the box is
not dragged more than it can show in the new position."*

`bp_solve_view()` / `ui_bandplan_move_view()` (`main/ui/ui.c`) **preserve the pan
exactly and move the dial by the drag**: box, VFO marker and passband translate
as one rigid object, and whatever offset the dial had inside the window it
keeps. The dial lands on a whole kHz, so the box lands within 500 Hz of where it
was dropped - under two pixels at band scale. Snapping the box instead would
drift the pan by the remainder on every drag.

⛔ **THE OBVIOUS DESIGN - pan freely, retune only when forced - WAS BUILT,
TESTED ON THE BENCH AND REJECTED. Do not re-propose it.** It leaves the radio
alone while the requested window is inside what it can hear, which sounds
exactly like what a still display wants. But **the QMX puts the VFO at +12 kHz
in a ±24 kHz baseband, so the reachable spectrum is `dial-36k .. dial+12k`** -
three times as much room below the dial as above. Dragging left moved the box
40 kHz with the dial untouched; dragging right ran out after a few kHz and then
dragged the dial along **welded to the box's left edge** (at x2 the pinned view
low edge is `dial + 12000 - span/2` = exactly the dial). Predicted from the IF
offset and then confirmed by the operator - *"the dial stay as much as possible
in a strange manner"*. The asymmetry is the RADIO's, so no bound can fix it, and
the window onto the band is 48 kHz wide however it is placed - so panning
without the dial buys very little and costs that. His call: *"we need to let the
dial follow the pan exactly as it were before panning."*

⛔ **AND IT WEDGED THE DEVICE FROM THE WEB - ui_bandplan_move_view() IS
LVGL-THREAD ONLY.** Applied on the httpd task (priority 5, 10 KB stack) it
stopped `fft_task` dead: the audio ring went permanently full
(`DROPPED=48000/s`), core 1 sat at **0.0% idle for 400 s**, the httpd worker
stopped answering, and LVGL carried on at 13 fps drawing the last frame it had -
so the screen showed vertical stripes and the browser lost contact, with **no
crash, no reboot and no allocation failure anywhere in the log.** The pan itself
had landed correctly one second earlier. It calls LVGL, reads the whole
`qmx_settings_t` via `update_bandplan_strip()`, and reconfigures the zoom FFT -
every one of those is a documented hazard above priority 4 here. The web
endpoint QUEUES (`ui_request_bandplan_view()`, drained by a 20 ms LVGL timer);
the discriminating test was a drag on the touchscreen, which does identical work
on taskLVGL and does not wedge.

⚠ **Open, found while measuring this:** `/api/status` omits `if_offset_hz` and
`cap_lo/cap_hi` whenever **zoom > 1** - they ride on the `ui_pan_view_current()`
path, which declines while the zoom FFT drives the display. The rigid rule
removed the only consumer, so nothing is broken today.

⛔ **A TAP IS STILL A TUNE.** Pointing at a place in the band means "go there";
dragging the window means "look there". It is the split the spectrum already
makes, and unifying them would break one of the two.

⚠ **The browser sends `{"action":"view_center","hz":N}`, NOT `set_freq`** - a
frequency write cannot express "leave the dial alone". `bpSolveView()` in
`index.html` is the same arithmetic so the preview, the release and the Tab5
cannot disagree. `still_view` had to join `/api/status` for it: it was only in
`/api/settings`, which the panadapter page never reads.

⛔ **And a browser tune path must arm `freqHoldUntil`.** The status poll carries
the radio's OLD frequency until the CAT write has gone out and come back, so
writing it into `lastFreqHz` snaps the display backwards and then forwards. The
wheel path fixed this for itself in v1.9.x and the other three - band-plan
commit, spectrum tap-to-tune, spot tune - were left behind for four releases.
`holdLocalFreq()` is the one way in now. The local **viewport** is carried with
the dial on commit for the same reason, one layer up.

### The band-plan strip is a RELATIVE control out of band (v1.8.3)
In band, a TAP is an absolute map: x is a frequency inside the band. Out of band
there is no band to map onto, so the same strip becomes centre-detented: the
knob (which already carries `<` `>` arrows)
sits mid-screen, you drag off centre to move the dial, and it springs back on release.
Full deflection = **half the visible span**, so consecutive drags overlap rather than
skipping a gap, and it scales with zoom for free.

Two things that are easy to get wrong here:
- **Deflection is measured from where the finger LANDED, not from screen centre.** Both
  agree when the knob itself is grabbed, but measuring from centre deflects the control
  the instant the strip is touched anywhere else — the dial jumps before the finger has
  moved.
- **A plain tap out of band does nothing, on purpose.** With no band plan behind it a
  tapped x has no frequency to mean. In band, tap-to-position is unchanged.

The in-band path rewrites the knob's position AND size every tick, so coming back in
band restores it with no reset needed.

### `/api/cmd {"action":"drawer","scroll_y":N}` — so a drawer section can be screenshotted
Same reason `ui_set_drawer_open()` exists. A section below the fold could not be
captured at all, so its layout could only ever be taken on trust — and a section whose
height and `y +=` disagree overlaps the one below it, which is exactly the mistake this
file warns about. Dev action only, no web UI element references it.

### The pointer's colour is a PROMISE, and the tune path must honour it (v1.8.1)
Tap-to-tune refused every release in the top 200 px outside `x=510..1089`, on the premise
that the Band/Mode/BW/Zoom hit zones "each span the full top 200px". They stopped doing so
on 2026-08-05, when their depth was cut to `spots_lane_top_hit_y() - 4` so they would stop
swallowing taps on the live-spot callsigns. **The check kept the old flat 200**, so a band
of the spectrum belonged to nobody: no dropdown opened AND no tune happened. The operator
described it as tuning "only when I get really close to the centre frequency", and fine in
the waterfall — both exactly what the surviving x-window and the waterfall's position
predict. Measured with a mouse: every click at `y=123..152` outside that window logged
`RELEASED in top-bar dropdown deadzone - ignored`.

**Deleted rather than re-derived, and that is the lesson.** `touch_event_cb` is attached to
`s_spectrum_obj`, so LVGL only calls it when the PRESS landed on the spectrum — if a hit
zone, a spot callsign, the RIT pill or an edge strip were under the pointer, that object
would have taken the press. Reaching the tune code already proves nothing clickable owned
the gesture, which is the same thing as the cursor having been white. **The operator's
invariant is the right one: green means a click acts on a control, white over the spectrum
must mean click-to-tune.** Cursor colour and click behaviour now answer one question —
LVGL's own hit-testing — instead of keeping a second hand-maintained copy of the geometry
that drifted. Do not add another deadzone.

### The QMX's dual-VFO display is NOT clearable over CAT — and `LC;` is how to see it
Roy KI0ER reported the QMX still showing both VFOs after the CW transmit offset is switched
off. The radio answers `SP;`=0, `FR;`=0, `FT;`=0 (and the manual says `FT;`=0 "must be VFO
Mode A") while its LCD renders both frequencies for the rest of the session.

**`LC;` returns all 32 characters of the 1602 including the VFO indicators**, which is the
only way to see what the radio is actually showing rather than what it reports. Use it
before theorising about anything display-related:
```
clean boot              LCA14,024,50                 12:12
split engaged           LCA14,024,50       14,024,56 12:13
after the stand-down    LCA14,024,50       14,024,50 12:13   <- still dual
after MU;               LCA14,024,50                 12:15   <- single
```
Ruled out on hardware: `FR1;`/`FR0;` and `FT1;`/`FT0;` (the indicator flips A→B→A, so the
writes are NOT ignored the way SSB-filter writes are — the layout persists anyway),
re-toggling `SP1;`/`SP0;`, and mode changes. Only `MU;` and a power cycle clear it, so the
dual layout is runtime state, not EEPROM.

⛔ **`MU;` DROPS IQ MODE — do not use it as a fix.** `Q9` is session state, so after `MU;`
the QMX keeps streaming USB audio at full rate while it is no longer I/Q: the spectrum goes
flat. `Q9;` reads 0 and `Q9 1;` restores it. **I approved `MU;` as "safe" on the strength of
`audio: RX 47763 pairs/s` being unchanged** — that figure proves the stream is flowing and
says nothing about its content, and the operator's screen showed the truth a minute later.
An `MM` Set under `MM Effect = Immediate` does **not** drop it (measured), so the two reload
paths differ deliberately; the 1_04_001 changelog records an earlier fix in exactly this
area ("CAT MU command and MM ... loaded previously saved state (VFO etc)"). Roy's workaround
is a band change, which reloads that band's config and redraws without touching session
state. Reported to QRP Labs via Stan KC7XE.

### ⛔ BLE HID: the report map needs a LONG read, and the report ID is NOT on the wire
Two facts that each silently broke Bluetooth keyboard support (#273), both found from
the device's own log rather than by reading code.

**1. `ble_gattc_read()` returns ONE ATT_MTU-1 payload — 22 bytes here.** A HID report
map is far longer. A Logitech K380's arrived cut off mid-descriptor, immediately before
its first `Input` item:
```
05 01 09 06 a1 01 85 01 95 08 75 01 15 00 25 01 05 07 19 e0 29 e7
Usage(Keyboard) Collection ReportID ... Usage Min/Max(E0-E7)   <- ends here, 22 bytes
```
So the parser saw a keyboard collection containing **no fields** and correctly reported
"no keyboard in this report map". **Every BLE keyboard would have failed identically**;
the mouse path only ever worked because a mouse descriptor fits in 22 bytes.
`ble_gattc_read_long()` (Read Blob) is required — it calls back once per chunk, then a
final time with `BLE_HS_EDONE`. Full map: **286 bytes**.

⚠ A previous attempt at this was REVERTED for stalling the subscription walk. It is safe
here because the walk is chained off the **discovery** EDONE in `hid_info_chr_cb()`, not
off the read completing. **Check that before touching this again.**

**2. A BLE report NEVER carries the report ID byte.** The descriptor can declare
`Report ID 1` — the K380 does — while the payload begins `00 18 00 ...`, because each
report has its own characteristic and the ID lives in its *Report Reference* descriptor.
Matching `p[0]` against the ID can therefore never succeed, and every keystroke fell
through to the mouse fallback and was decoded as pointer movement. **The report is
identified by the payload SIZE the descriptor declares** (`key_bit + key_count*key_bits`).

⚠ **Do not assume the 8-byte boot layout.** The K380 has **no reserved byte** — mods at
bit 0, keycodes from bit 8, 7 bytes total. Read the descriptor.

⚠ **Reports arrive ~2.5 s before the descriptor does** (CONNECT t=79.5 s, map parsed
t=82.0 s, measured). Anything typed in that window is buffered and replayed once the
layout is known — a keyboard waking from sleep types into exactly that gap. They are
deliberately NOT processed meanwhile: decoding them as movement jogs the pointer for
every key.

### BLE: two devices at once, per-link state, and why the 30 s drop is not a bug
`CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` is **2** — a mouse and a keyboard together.
Measured before changing it, because the objection was memory and the objection was
**wrong**: 1 → 2 costs **nothing** statically (`.bss` and `.data` byte-identical), since
NimBLE is built `MEM_ALLOC_MODE_EXTERNAL` and builds per-connection state at runtime in
PSRAM. Verified on hardware: `links in use: 2 of 2`, keyboard on handle 0, mouse on
handle 1, each with its own parsed layout.

⛔ **The layouts are PER-LINK (`hid_link_t`, `EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR`), and a commit that made
them global was falsified by hardware in minutes.** It argued *"s_layout is a mouse and
s_kbd_layout is a keyboard, they never contend"*. They contend: parsing the keyboard's
descriptor overwrote the shared mouse layout and the pointer froze. **A shared global is
not made safe by its two users having different intentions.**

⛔ **Scanning must RESUME after a successful connect**, or the second device is never
found — `ble_gap_disc_cancel()` runs to connect and nothing restarted it, so the log read
`links in use: 1 of 2` for ever. It restarts once a link's discovery is done, not at
connect, so it cannot slow the descriptor read everything waits on.

⭐ **The "unexplained" 30 s disconnect was never a fault.** The old comment argued it was
*"far too repeatable to be a battery-saving timer"* — backwards, since repeatability is
what a designed timer looks like. **`reason 531` = `BLE_HS_HCI_ERR(0x13)` = "Remote User
Terminated Connection"**: the peripheral hangs up. Confirmed on two Logitech devices at
30 s to the second. Nothing to fix; the lever is reconnecting fast (the post-drop burst).

⚠ **Fixing the truncated read EXPOSED a bug hiding under it.** With the map truncated, a
mouse's parse failed and it ran on `hid_fallback_decode()`, which ignores report IDs. Once
the descriptor parsed, the mouse path demanded `p[0] == report_id` on a report carrying no
ID byte and froze the pointer — the same BLE trap as the keyboard, one layer down.
**When a fix makes a previously-dead code path live, audit that path.**

### A cursor, or a status glyph, must not promise more than it knows
Two in one session, same shape — a UI element answering an easier question than the one
being asked of it.

**`lv_obj_add_state(ta, LV_STATE_FOCUSED)` paints a cursor but does NOT send
`LV_EVENT_FOCUSED`**, which is what records the field as the typing target. Four modals
pre-focused their first field that way, so it blinked before anything was chosen AND was
not necessarily where typing would go. The operator found both halves: *"a blinking
cursor is already blinking at the top line"* and *"its not focused - even if it blinks
already - i cannot type there yet"*. The helper is deleted with a tombstone. **The rule:
no cursor on open, a cursor once a field is selected** — the blink is an acknowledgement
that the touch landed, which matters most with a Bluetooth keyboard where nothing else
confirms it.

**The bottom-bar Bluetooth glyph was driven by `hid_cursor_present()`, set the instant a
link came up** — so it went blue ~2.5 s before a keyboard could type, and a keyboard-only
device claimed a mouse POINTER just by connecting. Presence is now earned: claimed when a
mouse layout parses, or on the first report that really decodes as movement. Blue means
**usable**, not connected. Verified against the keyboard's own LED going constant.

⚠ **A bounded 75% scan burst runs for 20 s after a bonded device drops** (a K380 hangs up
after ~30 s idle; rediscovery took EIGHT seconds at the normal 20% duty). **The 20% is not
a number to raise globally** — it was chosen after measurement because scanning starved
the WiFi/SDIO link. If WiFi or audio misbehaves just after a keyboard wakes, this burst is
the first suspect; its log line says `BURST after a drop`.

### ⛔ An `MM` Set is STORED, not APPLIED — "MM Effect" decides, and ours read "On demand"
The WSPR PA-voltage guard (#290) set `MMProtection|Max. PA voltage=7.5;`, the write
succeeded, the CAT read-back said **7.5 V**, and the radio's own Protection menu said
**7.5 V**. The burst then measured **5.4 W at 0.940 A** — full power. Four independent
indicators agreed with each other and **all four were describing STORED state**.

The QMX has an **"MM Effect"** parameter (`System config | CAT config`). Asked over CAT,
this bench radio answered **`MMOn demand;`** — meaning an MM Set is not applied until the
operator enters/exits a menu **or the host sends `MU;`**. Nothing in our path did either.

**So `MM<path>=<value>;` alone changes nothing you can measure.** The fix is
`MM` Set → `MU;` → **re-assert `Q9 1;`**, because `MU;` discards IQ mode (already recorded
above under `MU;`, and it bit again here). Verified: the same 7.5 V setting then measured
**2.4 W**, which is exactly what (7.5/12)² predicts on a 12 V supply.

⚠ **`MU;` also makes the value PERSIST.** A 11.5 V set without `MU;` evaporated across a
QMX power cycle; 7.5 V *with* `MU;` survived one. This supersedes the earlier reading of
that evidence ("MM Sets don't survive a power cycle") — they don't survive **un-reloaded**.

⚠ **Do not read this as "always send MU;".** It reloads the whole configuration and drops
session state; it is right for a deliberate, twice-a-session settings change and wrong on a
hot path.

### ⭐ The WSPR PA guard: what it actually buys, measured end to end
⛔ **RETIRED as of v1.14.0 (2026-09-16) - the fixed 6.0 V halving described below no
longer runs.** Calibrate Power + Declared power's own real-wattage classification
replaced it: picking a low declared dBm now IS how the finals are protected for a long
beacon run, with a plain >1 W warning label instead of a guard acting underneath the
operator. See this file's own "main" branch-state entry for v1.14.0 for the two-bug
retirement story (`wspr_pa_guard_update()` was the actually-live engage path, not the
one first disabled) and `wspr_rx.c`'s own comments at `wspr_pa_guard_update()` /
`wspr_pa_guard_ready()`. The measurements below are kept for the historical record of
what a fixed-voltage halving used to buy - they no longer describe live behaviour.

WSPR keys the PA for **~110 s out of every 120**. The radio's OWN Virtual U3S WSPR halves
its PA voltage for exactly this reason; our WSPR TX is CAT-driven (`TX;`/`TA;`/`RX;`) and
never enters that mode, so it inherits none of that protection.

Measured on the dev bench, 12 V supply, 20 m, idle 0.099 A, all three points self-labelled
by the firmware and cross-checked against `PC;`:

| PA voltage | I(tx) | P in | P out | Q507 | **Finals** | Total heat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~12 V (unguarded) | 0.841 A | 10.09 W | 5.4 W | 0 W | **4.69 W** | 4.69 W |
| 7.5 V | 0.558 A | 6.70 W | 2.4 W | 2.51 W | **1.79 W** | 4.30 W |
| **6.0 V (shipping)** | 0.454 A | 5.45 W | 1.6 W | 2.72 W | **1.12 W** | 3.85 W |

**The finals drop 4.69 → 1.12 W (76% less). TOTAL heat drops only 18%.** The guard largely
**moves** heat off the BS170s into Q507, the amplitude-modulator pass transistor, rather
than removing it. That is still the right trade — the finals are what fail — but it means
**the guard is not a substitute for running WSPR from a lower supply**, and the manual
should say so. QRP Labs' own manual agrees: *"High supply voltages can stress the PA
transistors, particularly when you are using Digi Modes with high duty cycle"*.

**The target is ABSOLUTE (6.0 V), not a fraction.** Halving whatever the operator's limit
happens to be is meaningless when that limit exceeds the supply: 15.0 on a 12 V rail meant
the PA really saw ~12 V and "half" gave 62% of it; a 20 V limit would have been halved to
10 V and changed nothing while the log reported success. 6.0 V is QRP Labs' own figure for
about 1 W. The guard **never raises** a limit that is already lower.

⚠ **The 9 V vs 12 V QMX matters in principle and is handled by measurement, not by a
model.** The supply range is **6.0–12.0 V** and the 9 V/12 V variants differ in PA
transformer winding (RWTST vs WTST). On a 9 V setup, a 6.0 V limit is (6/9)² = 44% of full
power rather than 25%, and Hans's "6.0 V ≈ 1 W" is presumably a 12 V figure. **Do not build
a table of radio versions**: `PC;` measures the actual output every burst, which is
version-, supply- and band-agnostic. The one case the target cannot help is a supply at or
below 6.0 V, where the limit does nothing — and the measurement says so.

⚠ **A guard that captures "whatever it finds" inherits whatever the last session left.**
Harmless in normal use, but a bench session that hand-sets the value makes it the
operator's new normal: on 2026-08-29 a diagnostic left this radio at 7.5 V, the guard
faithfully "restored" 7.5, and every mode would have been capped at ~2.4 W. The operator
remembered the true value (11.5) from the FIRST terminal reading, taken before anything had
written to the radio — later readings had been displaced by un-reloaded state. **The
earliest observation was the only clean one.**

### The QMX's CW centre is a 25 Hz grid from 500-950, and the radio's value must win
Two faults in one setting (Samuel W7STF, Roy KI0ER). The operation manual's table of all 54
filters gives centres of **500-950 Hz in 25 Hz steps**, and which are available depends on
the CW passband; the slider ran 600-800 snapping to **50**, under a comment asserting 50 was
the valid spacing. With the 150 Hz passband selected not one value a 50 Hz grid can produce
is achievable. `cat.c`'s read-back range check had the same 600-800 assumption and would
have discarded a radio genuinely set to 550. The bounds now live in `ui.h` so both use them.

**And the two numbers could never agree:** our stored value was pushed at ~4.5 s of boot and
CAT does not open until ~17 s, so that write went nowhere on EVERY boot — measured, with
timestamps. `ui_seed_cw_pitch_hz()` now adopts the radio's value at link-up and does NOT
write back. Verified by asking for 525 (unachievable at that passband), rebooting, and
watching the stored value corrected to the radio's real 700.

⚠ **Reading it ONCE was itself the next bug (#165, Roy KI0ER, v1.8.5).** `s_cw_offset_hz`
was written in exactly one place — that link-up sequence — and never refreshed, so the
moment the operator changed CW offset or centre **on the radio** our display compensation
froze at the link-up value for the session. The dial still agreed with the radio, the
waterfall did not, and tapping a CW signal tuned ~30 Hz off, i.e. he transmitted off
frequency as if XIT were on. His errors were non-linear in the value he asked for, which
is what a **stale constant** looks like — not a scale error, which is why his own formula
had to be withdrawn. `cw_offset_refresh()` in `poll_task` now re-reads it every 5 s,
CW/CW-R only. Two things measured before writing it, because the approach depends on both:
setting `CW center=650` drags **both** `CW offset` and `Sidetone freq.` to 650 (so that is
the right item and it does track the centre, as `Auto-offset/tone=YES` promises), and
repeated reads are stable with the passband untouched — **no `FW;`-style re-assert**, which
is the only reason polling it is safe.

⚠ **`CW offset` and `CW center` are DIFFERENT parameters with different ranges.** The
operation manual gives `CW offset` as valid **600-800** only ("so as to stay within the
bandwidth of the CW filter"); the 500-950 25 Hz grid above is `CW center`. Everything in
this section's first paragraph is about the centre. Do not apply one range to the other.

⭐ **AND THAT SPRAY REFUSES THE NEXT COMMAND — measured 2026-09-07, and it is
the reason a burst of MM writes needs spacing AND a read-back.** The CW-profile
apply (#359) sends eight `MMCW|Choose filters|N=…;` rows and then
`MMCW|CW center=…;`. At 40 ms spacing the eight rows all landed and the centre
was **refused** — the radio answered `?;` and stayed on its old value — while
the apply logged success, because it had only ever checked that it SENT the
bytes. Sent by hand with the port idle, the identical command answers `MM700;`
first time. So the fault is spacing, not syntax.

**Two rules from it.** Give an MM write **120 ms**, not 40, before the next
command. And **read the value back and retry** rather than trusting the write:
on the first real hardware test after the fix the centre still needed **three
attempts** (attempt 1 read back the OLD value, attempt 2 answered nothing,
attempt 3 confirmed), so even 200 ms of quiet is marginal. This is the WSPR
PA-guard trap in a new place — indicators agreeing about stored state while the
radio did something else — and the same answer applies: **`cw_filters_read()` is
called after the reload so the cached mask comes from the RADIO, not from what
was asked for.**

⚠ **An MM *write* sprays ANSI cursor-positioning bytes onto the CAT port.** Measured:
`MMCW|CW center=650;` came back as `[1;253H`, `[2;253H`, `[0;0H` and then `FA00014074000;`
— the radio redraws its menu and the escape codes land in the CAT stream. Our parser
recovered (the FA was still read), but anything that parses strictly, or a future MM write
on a hot path, needs to expect this. MM *reads* are clean.

### A clock we set cannot be a witness that the radio has GPS (#173, v1.8.5)
The bottom bar read `UTC(GPS)` on a QMX with no GPS. `time_sync.c` confirms
GPS-disciplined when the radio's `TM;` second-tick agrees with SNTP inside
`QMX_GPS_CONFIRM_MS` (300 ms), and the comment argued a push-set RTC could not pass,
being *"only whole-second accurate"*. **Wrong:** `cat_set_qmx_time()` sends `TM<hhmmss>;`
at whatever instant the call happens and the radio starts its second when it parses, so
the phase WE induce is uniform in **0..1000 ms**. Measured across successive pushes:
**12 ms, 834 ms, 154 ms, 404 ms** — the same code confirmed GPS or not purely on the draw.

`qmx_sync_once()` does detect before pushing, and its comment claimed that ordering was
sufficient. It is not: `s_qmx_detect_done` resets on a **Tab5** reboot while the clock we
pushed lives in the **radio**, which is not rebooted with us. Reflash with the QMX powered
and the "first" detection reads our own previous push.

**Not just a wrong label** — that is the part to remember. Once confirmed, `push_to_qmx()`
early-returns, so we **stop maintaining the clock of the one radio with no other source**
(a QMX's software RTC is explicitly not kept across a power cycle). And the verdict
persists, so an offline POTA session inherits it and `apply_gps_tick()`'s offline branch
starts accepting a free-running RTC as authoritative — the same class as Don WB0LQW's
v1.8.2 bug, pointing the other way.

Fixed with a persisted `qmx_time_pushed` (NVS `qmx_tpush`, dirty bit 90): while set, a
tight agreement is refused as evidence and logs why; cleared when the radio is >60 s out,
which is the power-cycle-to-00:00 moment its clock becomes its own again. On upgrade any
stored verdict is discarded and the flag assumed set — safe direction, since being wrong
costs a real GPS owner only the label while SNTP still keeps the clock right.

**Both branches hardware-verified**, and the second one needed engineering to reach:
detection is once-per-boot and the only other trigger is a Tab5 reset, which with the radio
attached is the #74 wedge (fired on 2 of 2 that day), and recovering from THAT needs a QMX
power cycle, which resets the radio's clock and destroys the precondition. Hence the dev
action **`{"action":"time_redetect"}`** → `time_sync_force_redetect()`, plus producing a
deliberately tight phase by sending `TM<hhmmss>;` through `cat_raw` ~220 ms ahead of a true
UTC second boundary. Result: `agrees to 154ms, but WE set this radio's clock - not treating
that as GPS`.

⚠ **Ordering note for anyone re-reasoning about this:** every boot runs SNTP → push →
detect, so the push that manufactures the agreement normally sets the flag in the same
boot. Persistence is load-bearing only when CAT is not ready as SNTP lands (`push_to_qmx()`
early-returns), which is exactly the slow/wedged-radio case that produced the report.

⚠ **Deliberate limitation:** a QMX+ we have already pushed to will not re-confirm until its
clock is next seen unset. The clean removal is to stop inferring and **ask the radio** —
`MMGPS & Ser. Ports|GPS source;` reads `Paddle port` vs `QMX+ Internal`. MM Get works and
returns bare values (verified: `MMSystem config|Real time clock;` → `MMSoftware;`, and the
`?` form returns the numeric path `MM5|16`). **Do NOT use `Real time clock` for this** — it
selects software vs CR2032-backed hardware RTC, not GPS. TODO #174.

### A fixed-size array indexed by an enum will be overrun by the next member you add
Three instances in one session, all the same shape. `N_DRAWER_SECTIONS` was 30 and
`DRAWER_SEC_*` ids ARE indices into `s_drawer_sections[]`; adding one as id 30 wrote past
the end into the neighbouring array and the garbage was used as an object pointer — Load
access fault, `MTVAL 0x6c`, boot loop, black screen, straight after "Settings drawer built".
`settings_post_handler` read the body into a fixed `char buf[1024]` with a SINGLE
`httpd_req_recv` and no loop, so one extra checkbox took the form past 1 KB and every save
failed with `400 "bad json"` and nothing saying the body was truncated. And
`hid_mouse_layout_t.total_bits` accumulated to the end of the whole descriptor (152 bits)
instead of the end of the report (56), so a length check against it discarded every report.
**Raise the bound in the same commit as the new member, and size a receive buffer from
`content_len` with a loop.**

### The mouse pointer advertises what is clickable — and new controls must opt IN or OUT (v1.8.0)
A touch UI has no hover states, so a mouse user cannot tell what is live. The pointer (`ui.c`, an arrow rasterised from ASCII art — two bitmaps, white and **bright green**, swapped on hover; recolouring tinted the black outline too and cost the arrow its readable edge) turns green over anything a click would act on. Getting that honest took four rounds of operator feedback, and the rules are load-bearing:

- **`UI_FLAG_NOT_HOT`** (`ui_theme.h`, `LV_OBJ_FLAG_USER_1`) marks a surface you click to **dismiss or drag**, not press: the drawer body and scrim, modal backdrops, the band-plan track, the tone strip, spectrum and waterfall. All are genuinely clickable, so nothing automatic can tell them from a control. **A new drag surface or dismiss target needs this flag**, or the pointer goes green nearly everywhere and means nothing.
- **A plain `lv_obj` with no event handlers is a background**, and so is any *display-only* widget (`lv_bar`, label, image) without one — that is what excludes section panels, FT8 panes and modal overlays without naming them, and it caught the top bar's S-meter. Classes that act when pressed (button, checkbox, dropdown, slider, switch, textarea, keyboard, roller, buttonmatrix) count regardless, since several here are read at Save time rather than through a callback.
- **Occlusion matters**: the search stops at the first object LVGL would deliver the press to. Without it the pointer reported things *behind* modal backdrops — the operator saw a "ghost area that reports but is not clickable".
- **A handle that is not itself clickable is reported by geometry** (`point_on_grip`): the edge grips and the band-plan knob deliberately let presses fall through to the strip that acts, so hit-testing alone would never find them. The tone modal took the other route — its picked cells became clickable and took the strip's own drag callbacks, so the white block is both grabbable and reported.
- Because the edge strips are full-height clickable objects where only the grip activates, a strip reports **only** on its grip.

⛔ **`clickable_at()` answers ONE question, and it is not "what would be pressed".**
It returns NULL for every `UI_FLAG_NOT_HOT` surface, which is its whole purpose -
and the spectrum and the waterfall both carry that flag. Wheel-to-tune (v1.9.6)
gated on `clickable_at(...) == s_spectrum_obj`, which is **unsatisfiable by
construction**, so the feature shipped completely inert and the operator found it
in a minute: *"cannot in any way change the center freq"*. Both questions now share
one walk - `hit_walk(..., bool hot_only)` - behind two names: **`clickable_at()`**
for "would a click act on a control?" (the pointer's colour) and
**`press_target_at()`** for "what object would LVGL deliver this press to?"
(hit-testing, occlusion). Reach for the second whenever the answer must include a
drag surface. And note the shape of the mistake: two different questions had one
implementation, so picking the wrong one compiled, ran, and did nothing.

Two things follow for the swipe gestures: the edge grips accept a **mouse click** (gated on the mouse indev, so a finger still behaves as before — a tap on the bottom strip must stay inert so reaching for it cannot retune), and the drawer and Memory Channels grew tappable handles on their **travelling** edge. The drawer's went on the right first and was wrong: that edge is pinned to the screen, so the handle sat still while the panel appeared from under it.

### No transition animations on this display — 220 ms is three frames (v1.5.0)

⭐ **MEASURED on the drawer, 2026-09-07, 12 gestures** — the figure above was
reasoned from the frame rate; these are the numbers. Temporary instrument in
`ui.c` behind `DRAWER_TIMING_DIAG` (left in place at **0**; flip it to 1 and
reflash to get them again):

| | total, press to settled | frames | worst gap inside it |
|---|---|---|---|
| drawer open | 253–288 ms | 3–4 | ~150 ms |
| drawer close | 263–457 ms | 2–4 | 119–268 ms |

So a 250 ms animation gets **two to four stills**, one of which can be a
**268 ms freeze** — which reads as stuck-then-jump, and is what the operator
called "stick/slip". Closes are slower and far more variable than opens: the
drawer is still fully drawn while it slides away, so there is more to
composite.

⚠ **And the animation is only half of it.** The same instrument measured the
worst **taskLVGL timer-pass gap** at **98–233 ms**, i.e. how long a finger can
rest on the glass before LVGL samples the touch at all. The event handler
itself was **1–8 ms every time**. So when a gesture feels slow on this board,
the handler is almost certainly innocent and the two real costs are *sampling*
and *frames* — check those before changing any UI code. Two fixes were made to
the drawer's scrim on the strength of feel before this was measured; both were
reasonable and neither could have touched the actual latency.
Landscape runs at ~13 fps (every flush goes through the software 90° rotation), so the Reader's 220 ms slide-in was **about three frames**: not motion, just two or three discrete snapshots at intermediate offsets, which reads as a flicker going in and as an unrelated page surfacing coming out. A cross-fade is the same three frames at 33/66/100 % opacity, so animating *differently* is not the answer — **one correct frame in, one out**. Generalise this before adding any transition: at 13 fps the only honest animation is none. (Related, different failure: `transform_rotation`/`transform_scale` on a large object can hang taskLVGL outright — see the watermark and wastebin notes.)

### No long interrupts-off critical sections — ANYWHERE — or the panel blanks (cyan flash)
Root-caused 2026-07-13 from an FT4 field observation (one-frame full-screen cyan/white flash every ~15 s–2.5 min): the MIPI-DSI frame-restart ISR runs on core 0, and a multi-ms interrupts-off window delays it past the vertical blanking window → the ST7121/ST7123 panel drops a frame and blanks to light cyan, then recovers. Two housekeeping walkers were doing exactly that every 10 s: `uxTaskGetSystemState()` (byte-walks EVERY task's stack for the watermark inside a kernel-lock critical section — several stacks are 64 KB in PSRAM) and `heap_caps_get_largest_free_block()` (walks every internal-heap block inside the heap spinlock). **Core-pinning does NOT contain the damage — hardware-falsified**: a core-0 task touching the same lock spins with its own interrupts disabled, propagating the stall to core 0 regardless of where the walker runs. Fixes (both hardware-verified clean, 10+ min FT4): `cpu_stats.c` v2 logs per-core idle% from `ulTaskGetIdleRunTimeCounterForCore()` (O(1)) instead of the per-task table; `audio.c`'s heap watchdog logs only O(1) counter queries (`free`/`min`/`psram`), running the `lblk` walk **only** below a 24 KB internal-free emergency threshold. Rules: don't reintroduce `uxTaskGetSystemState`/`heap_caps_get_largest_free_block`/`heap_caps_get_info` (or any full heap/stack walk) on ANY periodic path — on-demand-only diagnostics (the dev `resmon`) may use them, accepting a possible one-frame blink per invocation. The whole *digital* display path was exonerated on hardware along the way: DSI bridge underrun never fired, DSI host PHY/ECC/CRC registers stayed clean through observed flashes, DMA2D off changed nothing (and cost panadapter smoothness — it's back on), D-PHY LDO at 2600 mV changed nothing (back at 2500), and the FT4 decode burst ran flat-out with zero flashes once the walkers were gone. Note in passing: this unit's DSI link shows a standing `dphy_errors_4` (LP contention) on ~25% of 10 ms polls, constant from boot, voltage-independent, harmless as far as observed — don't panic if a future probe sees it. The AXI QoS priority raise for the scanout DW-GDMA (`display.c`, 12/15) predates the root cause, is harmless, and was kept.

### IDLE watchdog disabled
`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU0/CPU1` are off. The LVGL rotation pipeline keeps CPU0 busy past the default watchdog window. App-task watchdog (30 s) is still active.

### Audio task is polling, not event-driven
`audio_task` runs on core 0 with `uac_host_device_read` + a drain loop. Event-driven reads caused noise-floor pumping (slow ~13 s cycle) due to truncated UAC chunks saturating the FFT input. Do not revert to event-driven.

### USB ISO pipeline depth — do NOT shrink (#51 root cause, SOLVED 2026-07-19)
`CONFIG_UAC_NUM_ISOC_URBS=8` × `CONFIG_UAC_NUM_PACKETS_PER_URB=40` = **320 ms of queued isochronous transfers** (sdkconfig + sdkconfig.defaults). The Kconfig defaults (3×3 = **9 ms**) were the root cause of the years-long "first FT8 slots decode 60+, then collapse to a fraction" mystery: every post-decode storm (dual-core LDPC + LVGL decode-list rebuild) paused the ISO completion/resubmission pump >9 ms, the IN endpoint ran dry, and **~170–350 ms of QMX audio was lost at the USB wire every slot — zero error status, invisible to every software counter** (`drop=0`, `backlog=0` throughout; isochronous has no retry, a missed service interval is silence nobody logs). The hole clipped every signal's opening Costas sync array → same-station sync scores fell 5–13 pts with SNR unchanged → weak decodes died. Slots 0/1 were pristine only because no decode storm had happened yet. Verified fixed: capture windows tile at 180,027±152 samples (was ~175,656 ≈ −360 ms/slot); sustained 15.8 unique decodes/slot over 22 straight slots (was 6.3). Defense-in-depth shipped with it: UAC driver ringbuf 19,200 B → 288,000 B = 1 s (PSRAM — >16 KB allocs spill there), `audio_task` pri 3→6, and the fork (`components/espressif__usb_host_uac`, hand-patched — patch #2 and #3 now) WARNs+counts its formerly-silent ringbuf-overflow drop and logs 1 Hz `RX xport` ISO stats (~25 xfers/s is the NEW normal — 25×40 = the same 1000 pkts/s). Permanent cheap watchdogs for regressions: the `FT8 arm: start=` log (consecutive deltas must be ~180000 — an alternating/short delta = audio loss), per-slot `slotdiag`, per-decode `dt=`. If FT8 yield ever collapses again, **check window tiling first** — not the band, not the decoder.

### ⛔ A high-priority task that WAITS on display_lock() lends LVGL its priority — and that starved the USB audio (2026-09-11)
`handle_rx()` (the CDC-ACM data callback) runs on the driver's **"USB-CDC" task,
priority 10, core 0**, and it parsed CAT replies there — `process_cat_message()` →
`ui_refresh_bandplan_strip()` waits up to 100 ms for `display_lock()` on EVERY FA
reply. Whenever LVGL was mid-draw, the USB-CDC task blocked on the LVGL mutex and
**priority inheritance lifted taskLVGL 4 → 10**, above `audio_task` (6) and the UAC
driver task (5) on the same core: the isochronous pump starved and audio was lost
AT THE WIRE, and CAT stalled ("TX transfer timeout" ~1/s).

Measured on a WSPR page with the spot map open (it redraws ~1,300 line segments
per report): **11–13 % of each cycle's audio lost, 0 decodes**; after moving CAT
parsing to `cat_rx_task` (priority 4 = LVGL's base, core 1): **0.0 % lost, 3–4
decodes, 0 CAT timeouts**. It was also the "natural" 0.3–0.6 % loss on ordinary
cycles, and very likely the drawer-triggered audio gaps. The tell was
`cpu_owners` showing `taskLVGL` at **current priority 10** (base 4).

**The rule:** nothing above priority 4 may block on `display_lock()`. A callback
on a USB, BLE (`nimble_host` is 21) or timer task queues its work and lets the
LVGL thread or a priority-≤4 task apply it — the BLE keyboard path had the same
trap (500 ms wait on the NimBLE task) and now goes through a queue. A zero-timeout
try-lock is also safe (no wait, no inheritance) — `qmx_term.c`'s `on_rx` does that.

### ⭐⭐ The LVGL PORT's OWN 2 ms tick lent taskLVGL priority 22 (patch #19, 2026-09-13)
Opening the manual (or "Need guidance?", or the SelfSpotter map) reliably cost
7–16 CAT `TX transfer timeout`s and 200–300 ms of lost USB audio. The display_lock
fix above was already in, and the cause was one layer down, in esp_lvgl_port
itself: `lvgl_port_tick_increment()` runs on the **esp_timer task (priority 22)**
every 2 ms and took `timer_mux` with `portMAX_DELAY`. The LVGL task takes the
same `timer_mux` around `lv_indev_read()` **while already holding `lvgl_mux`**. A
tick during a touch read → esp_timer blocks → taskLVGL inherits 22 — and
⛔ **FreeRTOS disinherits only when the holder has released EVERY mutex it
holds**, so taskLVGL kept 22 for the whole `lv_timer_handler()` that followed,
outranking USB-CDC (10), audio_task (6) and the UAC driver (5) on core 0.

**Found by a task snapshot taken the instant a CAT send failed** (removed after):
`taskLVGL:R 4>22 c0, esp_timer:R 22, USB-CDC:R 10, audio_task:R 6, USB UAC Host:R 5`
— every USB task READY and not running. `esp_timer` is the ONLY base-22 task.
**Ruled out by direct test first, all at priority 4 on both cores:** a CPU busy
loop, 23 MB of PSRAM memcpy, internal-RAM memcpy, 500 ms of full-screen repaints
(AXI QoS for USB at 0 and 8), a flash write, a blocking CDC RX callback.

**Fix:** `tools/patches/apply_lvgl_port_tick_no_mutex.ps1` drops the mutex from the
tick — `lv_tick_inc()` is interrupt-safe by design (`sys_irq_flag` retry loop in
`lv_tick.c`). Edits `managed_components/`, so it is wiped by `fullclean`; in
`check_patches.py`. **Verified:** three manual opens afterwards, 0 CAT failures,
0 audio lost, audio 46.9–48.9 k pairs/s across each render.

⚠ **Generalise:** a lock taken from `esp_timer` callbacks is a priority-22 lender
to whoever holds it. And a sampler that walks every TCB every 10 ms reproduces the
cyan flash and starves the device (tried the same day) — sample the priority of
the few tasks you care about with `uxTaskPriorityGet()` instead.

**Safety net:** `dsp.c` `time_base_check()` holds the FT8/WSPR capture to the wall
clock — audio that never arrived is filled with silence where it went missing, so
a lossy WSPR cycle still decodes (A/B at 2 % simulated loss: 0/0/0 decodes without,
2/3/5 with). Only a shortfall persisting a whole 2 s bucket is filled (1.34 s is
buffered upstream, so a LATE sample is never mistaken for a lost one). The arm line
reports the arrived rate and `filled=N ms`. Dev actions `gapfill` (A/B, simulated
loss) and `spotmap` (open the map with nobody at the screen).

### A dead UAC handle used to peg core 0 — and that was what BLOCKED re-enumeration (fixed 2026-08-05)
`audio_task`'s `if (s_uac_dev) process_rx();` branch deliberately has **no `vTaskDelay`** (a 10 ms tick delay starved the read; #51 is the standing reminder). On a merely *silent* device that is safe, because `uac_host_device_read` honours its 25 ms timeout and the loop self-limits to ~40 Hz. On an **INVALID-STATE** device the read fails **instantly**, so the loop spun flat out at priority 6 → **core 0 at 0% idle**, LVGL starved, UI frozen, and `usbh_devs_open error: ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` logged every 50 ms for 100+ seconds with no task free to act on it. A Tab5 reboot was the only way out; the v1.3.6 auto-replug backstop never even ran.

**The spin was starving the very task that delivers `AE_DISCONNECTED`** — a self-sustaining starvation, not merely a symptom. Fix: `process_rx()` returns whether it moved any audio, and `audio_task` yields 5 ms when it did not. Hardware-verified on a QMX power-cycle, before → after: `usbh_devs_open` errors **thousands → 1**, `audio: UAC disconnected, cleaning up` **never → fires 20 ms later**, `USB: All devices freed` **never → yes**, worst `idle0` **0.0% → 7.2%**, and the radio **re-enumerated immediately** when powered back on instead of needing a reboot. Streaming unaffected (~48,000 pairs/s).

⚠ **Trap if this is ever refactored:** "did the last read return data" is the WRONG test — the drain loop always ends on an empty read, so a healthy stream looks idle on every poll and would take the delay 40×/s. Track whether *any* data moved during the call.

### QMX power cycle doesn't always re-enumerate USB (v0.15.5)
With the USB cable left connected, power-cycling the QMX often does not trigger `AE_DISCONNECTED`/`AE_RX_CONNECTED` — the UAC device stays open, audio just goes silent for a few seconds then resumes. `process_rx()` in `audio.c` detects this directly: any poll with zero bytes/pairs sets `s_flat_reset_pending`, and the next poll with real samples calls `ui_flat_mode_reset()`. This is what re-seeds the flat-spectrum floor after a power cycle — the old approach (resetting on `AE_RX_CONNECTED` / CAT reconnect) never fired because no reconnect event occurs.

### Waterfall double-height buffer
`1280 × 824` RGB565 canvas (2× waterfall height). Each tick writes the new row at `s_wf_head` and `s_wf_head + WATERFALL_H`, then moves the view pointer. Avoids `memmove` (~130 µs vs ~92 ms per tick).

### ⛔ The per-bin adaptive noise floor HAS NEVER RUN — the floors are re-seeded 17×/s
Measured on hardware 2026-08-11 (`FLATRESET: 90 resets in 5.1 s`, temporary instrumentation in `ui_flat_mode_reset()`, since removed). `audio.c`'s `process_rx()` sets `s_flat_reset_pending` on **any** poll that returns zero pairs, and the drain loop normally **ends** on an empty read — so `ui_flat_mode_reset()`, written for the QMX-power-cycle case (v0.15.5), fires continuously. It re-seeds **both** the flat-spectrum floor (`s_flat_ready = false`) and the waterfall floor (`render_waterfall_floor_reset()`).

So every draw starts from a fresh seed, and what the Tab5 actually shows is:

```
spectrum:  height = smoothed_bin - MEAN(bins) - FLAT_FLOOR_BIAS_DB   clamped 0..FLAT_RANGE_DB
waterfall: idx    = (sample - MEDIAN(bins) - black_db) * 255/contrast_db + 32
```

**Consequences, all real:**
- The per-bin tracker in `render_waterfall.c` (`floor_arr`, `WF_FLOOR_ATTACK`, `WF_FLOOR_DECAY_SLOW`) and in `ui.c` (`s_flat_floor`, `FLAT_FLOOR_UP_ALPHA`) is inert. It is seeded, updated **once**, and thrown away.
- **The "Adaptive floor (%)" drawer setting does nothing**, because `floor_arr[bin]` and `floor_global` are always the same value, so the blend has nothing to blend. **Removed from the web settings form entirely (2026-08-11, operator's call)** — a control that cannot change anything is worse than a missing one, since it invites tuning something that is not there. The value is still stored, still in the config export, and `/api/settings` still accepts it, so the row returns and works the day this is fixed. **REMOVED FROM THE TAB5 DRAWER TOO in v1.8.3** (operator's call, after Samuel W7STF asked why the waterfall has so many handles). It lived inside `DRAWER_SEC_WATERFALL` beside black level, contrast and the FFT window, so taking it out meant the reflow this file warns about: everything below moved up 80 px and the section height AND the `y +=` at the end of the block moved with them — those two must always move together or the next section overlaps. Verified on a screenshot rather than by reading the arithmetic, via the new `scroll_y` dev action below. `drawer_slider_wf_blend_cb` and its two statics went with it; `settings_set_wf_floor_blend()` and `render_waterfall_set_floor_blend()` are still live (main.c applies the stored value at boot, webserver.c still sets it), so the row comes straight back the day the tracker runs.
- `s_flat_smooth`'s own EMA never accumulates either — it is re-seeded to the current value each time. Only `render.c`'s `s_ema_alpha` (the "Spectrum smoothing" setting) and `WF_EMA_ALPHA` actually smooth anything.

**Do not "fix" this casually.** The behaviour above is what the operator knows and likes: responsive, signals always visible. Letting the designed tracker run makes steady carriers **fade into the floor over ~60 s** (a 50 s rise time constant) — verified, because the browser implemented the DESIGN faithfully and that is exactly what it did, which is how this was found. Fixing `audio.c` means re-tuning the floor constants at the same time and getting the operator to judge the result.

The browser mirrors the real behaviour behind one `FLOOR_TRACKING` switch in `index.html`; flip it the same day `audio.c` is fixed so both screens change together.

### 12 kHz IF offset
The QMX presents IQ with +12 kHz IF offset — the VFO signal lands at +12 kHz in baseband. Spectrum and waterfall shift bin selection by `n_bins/4` to center the VFO signal visually. Touch-to-tune math uses the raw CAT frequency, so no adjustment needed there.

`dsp_get_peak_dbm_around_vfo()` (used for the S-meter and the web UI's `signal_dbm`) must be centered on this same IF-shifted bin (`ui_get_if_bin_shift(DSP_FFT_SIZE)`), not on raw bin 0 (DC). Before v0.15.5 it searched around DC, which is dominated by constant DC/LO leakage — the S-meter read a near-constant S6 regardless of actual signal.

### FT8 capture window must be UTC-boundary-capped, not fixed-sample-count (v0.15.1)
`dsp_ft8_capture()` used to wait for a fixed 180000 samples (nominally 15.000 s @ 12 kHz). The QMX's USB audio clock isn't bit-exact 48 kHz, so 180000 samples actually take a hair over 15.000 s wall-clock — the capture window slides later by ~0.2–0.4 s every slot. After ~12–15 slots (~3 min) the FT8 signal falls outside ft8_lib's decoder time-search window: candidates stay high (~140) but decodes drop to 0. A mode-bounce (FT8 → Panadapter → FT8) "heals" it by resetting to a fresh UTC boundary — that was the tell that pinned this down.

Fix: `ft8_task` (`ft8_test.c`) computes `ms_to_boundary = 15000 - start_off_ms` and passes that as the capture timeout (clamped to `[2000, SLOT_TIMEOUT_MS]`). `dsp_ft8_capture()` treats hitting that boundary as the normal case — it zero-pads any sample shortfall (dead air after the FT8 signal) instead of returning `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`. The per-slot log gained `off=%+dms` (capture-start offset from the UTC boundary): should stay near 0 forever; if it climbs again, the anchor is broken.

### FT8 continuation-message resend is structural, not a bug — `cap+dec` routinely exceeds the 15 s slot
A real QSO log (Dirk DK7CVD, 2026-06-29) showed every reply in an exchange (report, RR73, 73) being transmitted twice. Cause: `cap≈15.1s` (capture, deliberately runs to the UTC boundary per the fix above) **+** `dec≈1.0-1.6s` (LDPC decode pass over `ftx_find_candidates()`'s up-to-`FT8_MAX_CANDIDATES` (140) sync hits) together exceed the 15 s slot period available before our *own* next reply is due to fire — so decoding the partner's message routinely finishes just after we've already re-armed and re-sent the previous one. The existing "deferred arming" design (`advance()` updates `s_cur_req`; the *next* `on_tx_complete()` rearm picks up the fresh content) self-corrects this one cycle later, which is why the QSO still completes — it just costs an extra 15 s per affected step. `bp_decode()` (`components/ft8_lib/ft8/ldpc.c`) only exits early on success (`errors==0`) or the degenerate all-zero case; a failing candidate (the majority on a busy band — most of the 140 are false-positive syncs) always burns the **full** `FT8_LDPC_MAX_ITERS` iteration budget before giving up, so decode time scales with however many candidates fail, not how many succeed. Lowered `FT8_LDPC_MAX_ITERS` 30 → 15 (2026-06-29, `ft8_test.c`) to shrink this — measured ~25-30% dec_ms reduction on hardware (cand=140 slots: ~1.5s → ~1.0-1.3s). **RESTORED 15 → 30 (2026-07-19, #51):** the cut's entire reason was decode-vs-next-TX timing, which the hold-for-decode gate (below) has since made structural rather than time-sensitive — and the decode budget runs ~85% idle, so 15 iters was abandoning marginal weak-signal candidates for no remaining benefit. Measured +34% unique decodes/slot from the restore alone. FT4 stays at 30 (never cut twice).

**FT8-only — do not apply the same cut to FT4.** `decode_candidate_range()` (`ft8_test.c`) doesn't distinguish protocol by default since it's shared code, but `FT8_LDPC_MAX_ITERS` is now FT8-specific; FT4 uses a separate `FT4_LDPC_MAX_ITERS` (30, the pre-cut value), picked at decode time off `s_pool_proto`. Found 2026-06-30, same-day field report: applying the FT8 cut to FT4 too "almost destroyed" FT4 decode. FT4's slot is half FT8's (7.5s vs 15s) so the resend-timing pressure that motivated the FT8 cut doesn't apply the same way, and FT4's LDPC code (different parity matrix) needs more iteration headroom to converge than FT8's. **Any future LDPC iteration tuning must be evaluated per-protocol, not assumed to transfer between FT8 and FT4.**

### FT8 double-send FIXED (2026-07-15): hold-for-decode gate — NOT YET FIELD-VERIFIED
The resend described above is now closed by a **hold-for-decode gate** rather than by making decode faster (impossible: capture deliberately runs TO the boundary, so decode can never finish before it). Root cause quantified from Jonathan KN6LFB's v0.21.0 diag log: every QSO advance lands at boundary +1.6–1.9 s, every armed burst used to fire at boundary +0 ms — the fresh reply missed its own slot by ~1.7 s, every exchange step went out twice, every QSO took double time. Fix (3 files): (1) `ft8_test.c` slot loop — when a TX is due (`ft8_tx_slot_would_run()`, new side-effect-free peek in `ft8_tx.c`), the QSO machine is busy (`ft8_qso_is_busy()`), and the previous RX slot's decode is still in flight (`s_decode_jobs_queued`/`s_decode_jobs_done` counters), the boundary does NOT fire the armed request; the slot falls into the normal RX-capture branch and the existing reply-on-immediate-slot poll (`FT8_REPLY_TX_WINDOW_MS`, on-air validated at +1032 ms) fires once the decode has landed — or at `FT8_TX_HOLD_DEADLINE_MS` (2300 ms) fires whatever is armed, so the worst case is exactly the old resend behaviour, never a skipped slot. (2) `ft8_qso.c` — `arm_current_replacing_armed()`: advance()'s progress paths now replace the still-ARMED stale request with the fresh message immediately (`ft8_tx_arm()` overwrites ARMED, refuses only ACTIVE), instead of waiting for the next `on_tx_complete()`. Net: the burst fires ~1.7–2.0 s into the slot carrying the FRESH message (partner sees DT ≈ +1.4 s, well inside decoder tolerance), and a completed QSO no longer wastes a full stale re-transmission after the partner's RR73. FT8-only (gated `!is_ft4`, same as the late-TX path). Log tells: `holding for fresh reply` at the boundary, then the existing `reply armed mid-slot (+Nms)` line. If a field log ever shows the deadline path firing constantly, decode has slowed past 2.3 s — fix that, don't widen the deadline past `FT8_REPLY_TX_WINDOW_MS`.

### Whitespace is SYNTAX in a 77-bit message — and `encode() == OK` proves nothing about meaning
Don WB0LQW's CQ presets keyed the radio for the full 12.6 s at 3.2 W and nothing decoded
at the far end. His preset was stored as `CQ  POTA WB0LQW` — **two spaces**, confirmed byte
by byte in his own `built text CQ:` log line. Preset 1 had one space and always worked.

With the extra space `ftx_message_encode()` stops seeing a CQ and encodes a **signal report
to a hashed callsign**, so a perfectly valid frame goes out reading `CQ  <...> +00`. With a
grid appended it returns rc=5 (`ERROR_TYPE`) and never keys at all — the "Operator Identity
modal appeared" symptom. All three reproduced from that one character by
`test/ft8_cq_encode_harness.c`, which links the real `ft8_lib`.

**The same defensive trim existed in BOTH `ft8_cq_modal.c` and `ft8_tx.c`**, both added
after a 2026-07-15 field hit where a *leading* space broke the same message, and **both
stripped only the edges**. Fixing the reported instance instead of the class cost a second
field report a month later.

`main/ft8_msg_guard.c` (portable, no ESP deps, linked by the harness) now holds both halves:
- `ft8_msg_normalize()` collapses interior runs as well as trimming, used by both call sites
  and the editor's display path, so a badly-stored preset repairs itself visibly on reopen.
- `ft8_msg_roundtrip_ok()` decodes the payload back the way the far end will and **refuses
  to key** if the meaning changed.

⛔ **Do NOT tighten that guard to a byte comparison.** The protocol legitimately drops tokens
it has no room for — `CQ POTA PJ4/K1ABC` transmits as `CQ PJ4/K1ABC` and `CQ VK9/WB0LQW DN70`
as `CQ VK9/WB0LQW`. Refusing to key a nonstandard-callsign operator would be worse than the
fault being guarded against. The invariant is **meaning**: a CQ stays a CQ, and the
operator's callsign survives. Don's message failed both.

### Nonstandard/special callsigns ("<...>" three-dots) FIXED (2026-07-15): callsign hash table — NOT YET FIELD-VERIFIED
Field report (Dirk DK7CVD): long/special callsigns decoded as three dots and their answers to his CQ were never recognized. Root cause: every `ftx_message_decode`/`encode` call passed `NULL` for ft8_lib's `ftx_callsign_hash_interface_t` — FT8 transmits nonstandard calls (PJ4/K1ABC etc.) as 22/12/10-bit hashes and expects the receiver to keep a table of full calls to resolve them; without one they render as `<...>`, and (worse) a special-call station's ANSWER carries **our own call as a 12-bit hash**, so it can't match `s_my_call` either. Fix: new `main/ft8_hash.c/.h` — 256-entry table in PSRAM, mutex-protected (decode runs on two tasks concurrently), auto-populated by ft8_lib on every full call packed/unpacked, own call explicitly seeded at ft8_task start (`ft8_hash_seed()` — our call never appears in anything we decode). **Do not copy ft8_lib's `reference/test_main.c` hashtable**: its `(hash*23)%SIZE` probe is broken for 12/10-bit lookups (those are the TOP bits of n22, so the probe starts at the wrong index) — `ft8_hash.c` does a plain linear scan with round-robin eviction instead. Wired into: both decodes in `ft8_test.c`, the three encodes in `ft8_tx.c` (this also un-breaks ARMING a reply to a nonstandard call — `encode_std` used to fail outright with hash_if=NULL). Resolved calls come back **in `<angle brackets>`** — stripped centrally in `ft8_qso.c`'s `split_msg3()` and `ft8_screen.c`'s `extract_remote_call()` so all matching runs on bare calls. `scan_for_reply_to_me()` also now accepts an **empty third field** (an i3=4 nonstd answer has no room for a grid — previously skipped as "no third field"). Boot self-test `ft8_hash_selftest()` (main.c, inline) round-trips both hash directions.

### FT4 clock-sync timing was silently wrong (~3.3x scale error), fixed 2026-06-30
`decode_candidate_range()`'s per-candidate timing-offset calc (`ft8_test.c`) hardcoded FT8's block geometry (`1920` samples/symbol, `960`-sample subblock) regardless of which protocol actually decoded — FT4 uses `576`/`288`. The v0.18.9 FT4-engine commit (`40d9b60`) noticed the auto-sync consumer of this value would be unsafe for FT4 ("timing offset is protocol-scaled, shouldn't pollute the system clock yet") and gated the *auto-sync application* off for FT4, but left the *underlying offset calculation* itself wrong — so the manual time-sync modal's tap-to-Apply path was still silently computing garbage offsets if ever used while in FT4 mode (the modal has no protocol gate of its own). Fixed at the source: `mon->block_size`/`mon->subblock_size` (already correct per-protocol fields on the `monitor_t` the candidate was decoded against) replace the hardcoded FT8 constants, and the FT8-only auto-sync gate was removed now that the math is right for both protocols. This was TODO item #5.5 (FT4 time sync) — turned out to be a real bug fix, not new-feature work; "hide Sync Time in FT4 mode" (the TODO's original fallback suggestion) is no longer needed.

Three UI follow-ups shipped same day once the underlying math was confirmed fixed: the bottom-bar clock suffix (`util/status.c`) read a constant `TIME_SOURCE_FT8` enum name and always printed `UTC(FT8)` even while actually in FT4 — now checks `ft8_op_mode_get()` and prints `UTC(FT4)` when appropriate. `ft8_filter_modal.c`'s "Sync Time" button had been deliberately hidden in FT4 mode (dead code now, the gate was removed) since the modal would have silently produced garbage corrections — that's no longer true. `ft8_time_modal.c`'s ("Set and Sync the Clock") hint text, SS-box flash label, and log line all hardcoded "FT8" in four places; added `active_proto_label()` so they say "FT4" when appropriate. Verified on hardware.

## CAT

Kenwood-style. Round-robin poll: `FA` (freq) / `MD` (mode) / `FW` (passband width), 50 ms intervals — each field refreshes every ~150 ms. CAT writes rate-limited to one per 200 ms. Touch-to-tune optimistically updates the freq label on write without waiting for the next FA poll.

### QMX firmware version via `VN;`
`VN;` returns `VN<version>QMX;` (e.g. `VN1_03_002QMX;`) — the QMX/QDX firmware version, same string as the firmware filename without the dot. Queried once at CAT link-up (`process_cat_message` parses it into `s_qmx_fw`; `cat_get_qmx_fw()` exposes it). Surfaced in the boot/diagnostic log (`QMX firmware: ...`), the diag-log enable header (`qmx_fw=...`), and the web `/api/status` JSON (`qmx_fw`). Note `ID;` returns only the emulated Kenwood model (`ID020;` = TS-480), **not** the QMX firmware — use `VN;` for that. Confirmed on hardware (dev bench QMX is on `1_03_002`).

### QMX `1_04` beta firmware — still unverified against real hardware; full 1:1 CAT comparison done (2026-07-03)
Not tested at all against a real `1_04` unit — `1_03_002` remains the recommended/known-good firmware in the quick-start guide. **The complete 1_03_002↔1_04_002 comparison lives in `docs/qmx-1_04-cat-comparison.md`** (command-by-command CAT diff from the actual vendor manuals — both cached in `docs/qmx-reference/`, gitignored — plus our-code impact map, ranked feature opportunities, and the hardware verification checklist). Three beta releases so far: `1_04_000` 08-May-2026 QMX+-only, `1_04_001` 12-Jun-2026, `1_04_002` 18-Jun-2026 (no CAT changes vs `_001`; forces a Factory Reset on install) — all still BETA, no GA release yet. This is TODO item #22. Summary below; the doc is authoritative.

**CAT changes relevant to our code, not yet handled:**
- `MD8;` enters SWR Tune mode (`MD0;` exits) — our Kenwood mode table maps raw digit 8 to `"?"`, cosmetic-only gap, not a crash
- `MD` command expanded to include AM (mode 5), added in `1_04_001` — our mode table already labels digit 5 as "AM" (an earlier version of this note claimed otherwise; `kw_modes[]` in `cat.c` has handled 1–9 including AM all along)
- `MU;` forces a complete config menu reload — unimplemented on our side, not currently needed for anything we do
- `PS`/`KD`/`TR`/`RR` (power-supply status, key-down get/set, tune/RIT rate) — all unimplemented, no current use case
- `PC;` already re-calibrated for the 3-digit-at-≥10W change (`cat_query_power_swr()`/`cat_pwr_swr_async_read()` in `cat.c`)
- `AI` (Auto Info) gained proper modes (Old/Extended/Both) in `1_04_000` — **do not test this blind.** `Do not call AI1; on the QMX CAT port` above is about the *current shipping firmware's* broken behavior (corrupts FA polling for the session); if `1_04`'s AI rework actually fixed that, it'd be worth knowing, but only verify against a real `1_04` unit, never assume it's fixed from the changelog alone

**Possibly relevant to existing workarounds:** `1_04_001` changelog states "CAT MU command and MM loaded previously saved state" was corrected — this *might* interact with our hard-won SSB-filter-bandwidth dance (`MMSSB|Filter RX=`/`MMSSB|Bandwidth=`/`FW;`-suppression, see below), since that workaround exists specifically because reading the filter via CAT made the QMX re-assert a stale value. Don't assume this fixes anything without testing — flag it as a thing to re-check once `1_04` hardware is available, not a reason to simplify the workaround now.

A field report (Dirk DK7CVD) showed IQ mode reading as disabled in the QMX's own System Config menu on `1_04` despite our `Q9 1;` write reporting success at the CDC layer — addressed from our side by the `Q9;` readback fix below, but the root cause on the QMX side is still unverified.

**What's new in `1_04` beyond CAT** (AM RX mode, "Virtual U3S" — an independent QRSS/WSPR beacon mode running inside the QMX, LCD grid-editing UI, SSB "Symmetric phase" quality improvement, fullscreen CW practice decode) is QMX-native firmware functionality, not something our panadapter currently surfaces or needs to react to — noted here in case any of it implies a future CAT surface we'd want to expose (e.g. AM mode support, if/when `1_04` GAs).

**AM mode selection + SWR Tune button — implemented 2026-07-03, NOT YET FIELD-VERIFIED.** Both are gated behind `cat_qmx_fw_at_least(1, 4, 0)` (parses `cat_get_qmx_fw()`, the cached `VN;` string) so they're invisible on `1_03_002` — zero risk to existing users. Re-evaluated live via `ui_notify_qmx_fw_known()`, called from `cat.c`'s `VN;` handler, in case the drawer was already built before the firmware string arrived.
- **AM**: added to the touch mode popup (`mode_popup_open()` in `ui.c`) and the web UI's mode dropdown (`index.html`, gated by a JS port of the same version check against `/api/status`'s `qmx_fw` field). The CAT-layer mapping (`hamlib_mode_to_digit`, digit 5) already existed — this was purely a "no way to tap it" gap. **Unverified: what `FW;` returns in AM mode** — the manual doesn't say, and our passband-width label/overlay could show something wrong if it's unexpected. Check on first real 1_04 contact before trusting the BW display in AM.
- **SWR Tune**: a dedicated drawer button (`DRAWER_SEC_TUNE` in `ui.c`, panadapter-only, built last so hiding it never leaves a gap or needs reflow — same reasoning as the FT8-only sections). Deliberately NOT folded into the mode popup: Tune keys the radio continuously, so it gets the same "can't trigger by accident, visibly ACTIVE while engaged" treatment as FT8 TX/robot mode, not one-tap access. Entering sends `cat_request_mode("TUNE")` (→ `MD8;`, deferred through the poll task like every other mode write); a live SWR/power readout polls `PC;SW;` via a new poll-task 4th phase (`cat_tune_poll_set_active()`) only while Tune is active. **Exiting deliberately does NOT send a bare `MD0;`** — the CAT manual's own `MD` Set list is `1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9`, and `0` never appears in it (an earlier note claiming "`MD0;` exits" traced back to changelog research, not the manual body — see `docs/qmx-1_04-cat-comparison.md`). Instead the button remembers whatever mode was active before Tune was entered and restores that. **There is NO radio-side exit detection, and there cannot be one over `MD;`** — see the `MD8;` readback quirk below; a 60 s auto-timeout is the only automatic exit, so the radio can't be left transmitting indefinitely if a write is ever dropped. **Unverified: whether restoring the prior mode digit actually exits the radio's own Tune UI cleanly** — this is the first thing to test on real 1_04 hardware, per `docs/qmx-1_04-cat-comparison.md` §5.

### `MD;` reports the PRE-Tune mode while the radio is tuning — never treat it as ground truth
After `MD8;`, a `MD;` Get returns **the mode you were in before**, not `8`. Found here on hardware 2026-07-03 (the QMX echoed the pre-Tune digit for the entire time it was genuinely transmitting a tune carrier) and independently confirmed by Stan KC7XE 2026-08-09: *"when you set `MD8;` if you use `MD;` to read the mode, it will return the prior mode you were in, not the current MD8 mode"* — arguably a feature (the radio is remembering where to return to) rather than a bug, but either way it is the documented behaviour to code against.

Consequences, all already handled — **do not "fix" any of them by trusting the echo**:
- `tune_modal.c`'s `s_active` is set and cleared **only** by our own button/timeout/Cancel logic. An early version derived it from the `MD;` echo and silently detached the UI from a still-transmitting radio.
- Mode digit `8` is effectively **unreachable via the poll**, so `kw_modes[]`' `"TUNE"` entry never shows during a CAT-entered tune. Cosmetic, and arguably correct.
- The CW split maintainer (`cw_split_maintain()`) gates on `s_last_mode_digit` `'3'`/`'7'`, which therefore stays engaged through a tune started from CW — the tune carrier goes out on VFO B, i.e. offset by up to ~600 Hz. Deliberately left alone: that is nowhere near enough to change an SWR reading on an HF band, and standing split down mid-tune would add a state interaction for no gain.

### `Q9 1;` (IQ mode enable) write success ≠ the QMX actually accepting it
A successful `cdc_acm_host_data_tx_blocking()` only proves the USB bytes reached the radio, not that the QMX parsed/applied them. `link_task` (`cat.c`, right after `Q9 1;`) also sends `Q9;` and waits up to ~400 ms for the readback, logging "QMX IQ mode confirmed ON" or a warning with the raw response if it doesn't read back `1`. Without this we had zero way to distinguish "IQ mode is on" from "the write silently did nothing" — exactly what happened in the field case above.

**The confirm check alone wasn't enough — it needed a retry, not just a log line (fixed v0.19.3).** A second field report (Dirk DK7CVD, groups.io #172933, 2026-06-30) showed the actual failure mode this check was built to detect: on a real connect, the `Q9 1;`/`Q9;` handshake can fail outright (`raw='(no response)'`), and the single-shot version of this code just logged a warning and moved on — the *entire session* then ran with IQ mode off. Without IQ mode the QMX streams plain (non-IQ) audio, which produces a very specific, very confusing symptom: the panadapter signal appears shifted, is tunable across the *whole* 48 kHz window with the QMX's own VFO knob (because there's no proper baseband centering without IQ), and audio is only present once retuned back into range — fixed only by power-cycling the QMX (which forces a fresh handshake on reconnect). This was misdiagnosed at first as a spectrum/waterfall rendering desync (TODO item #27) before Dirk's SD-persisted diag log pointed straight at the `IQ mode NOT confirmed` warning line.

Fixed in `link_task`: the `Q9 1;`/`Q9;` handshake now retries up to 4 times (300 ms apart) before giving up, via `cat_get_iq_mode_confirmed()`. Verified live on the dev bench the same evening — attempt 1 reproduced Dirk's exact `(no response)` failure, attempt 2 confirmed IQ mode ON, both within ~700 ms of each other. If all 4 attempts still fail, `ui_set_iq_mode_warning()` (`ui.c`) raises a persistent red banner across the top of the screen — a log-only warning is invisible to a user who isn't watching `/api/log` live, which is exactly how Dirk's earlier sessions went undiagnosed for so long.

### USB CDC disconnect race could abort/reboot the Tab5 (found 2026-06-29 from a field serial capture)
When the QMX drops off USB, `link_task`'s cleanup (`EVT_DEV_GONE` handler in `cat.c`) used to call `cdc_acm_host_close(s_cdc_dev)` immediately, with no coordination against `poll_task`, which can still be mid-retry on that exact handle (the v0.18.6 "tolerate up to 20 consecutive transient TX failures" change widened this window — before that fix, `poll_task` died on the very first failure, narrowing but not eliminating the race). The two tasks touching the same `cdc_acm_dev_hdl_t` concurrently corrupted the USB host driver's internal state; `cdc_acm_host_close()`'s `usb_host_interface_release()` returned `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` into an `ESP_ERROR_CHECK`, which aborted and rebooted the device. Root-caused from a serial capture (Dirk DK7CVD) reproducing the crash specifically after using the QMX's SWR Tune submenu then power-cycling — the disconnect itself, not the tune submenu, is the actual trigger; any QMX disconnect while the poll task is in a retry burst can hit this. Fixed: the cleanup path now clears `s_cdc_dev` first (so `poll_task`'s `while (s_cdc_dev != NULL)` check exits at its next iteration) and waits, bounded to 4 s, for `s_poll_task` to actually become `NULL` before calling `cdc_acm_host_close()`.

### QMX volume (`AG`) is in 0.25 dB steps and the radio shows dB on its own LCD
`cat_request_af_gain()` / `cat_query_af_gain()` / `cat_get_af_gain()` (`cat.c`), driven by the drawer's "QMX volume" slider. Three vendor-doc facts that agree and must stay in step:
- **Set/Get is `AG0nnn;`** in **0.25 dB steps**, range **000-799** (CAT manual: `AG091;` = 22.75 dB; Get returns `AG0091`). The manual's Set example drops the leading zero but its Get reply is 3-digit, so **we send the 3-digit form** — that's the one the radio demonstrably speaks.
- **The QMX displays volume in DECIBELS on its own LCD** (operation manual, "Volume change" parameter: *"the new volume is displayed momentarily on the bottom left of the LCD. The volume is shown in decibels."*). So the slider is in **dB** = AG/4, deliberately matching the radio's display. **Do not turn it back into a percentage** — the operator's requirement was that the number match the LCD exactly.
- **The knob's range is 0-200 dB** (operation manual, audio chain step 23: *"the 0 to 200dB gain selected by the volume control knob"*), and 799 × 0.25 = 199.75 — but `CAT_AF_GAIN_DB_MAX` (the SLIDER's top) is deliberately **50**, not 199 — a full-range slider put every wanted setting in its leftmost ~2 cm. The 50 took THREE rounds with Randy N4OPI, the only person who has measured it against a radio: (1) "usable is the first ~10% of the range, anything beyond is way too loud" reads as ~20 dB so the cap went to 40; (2) after using it, 40 "not quite loud enough for weak signals down at the noise floor" → briefly 70; (3) he then retracted round 2 — **he had been listening with the ANTENNA OFF**, so what was missing was band noise, not gain range; with the antenna on "40 seems plenty loud now. Maybe 50?" → 50. Two lessons, both kept in cat.h's header comment: "too loud beyond X" describes where COMFORTABLE listening ends, not where the useful range does, and **ask what the antenna was doing before acting on a loudness report**. 50 dB gives ~10 px/dB. If the radio is turned higher on its own knob the slider knob pins at the end but the LABEL still shows the true dB — the label is what must agree with the LCD.

The slider **reads the radio back on drawer open** (`drawer_refresh_qmx_vol`) rather than showing our last write — otherwise it disagrees with the LCD the moment the operator uses the physical knob. The NVS value is only a fallback position for before the radio has answered, and is **never pushed at boot**, so a stored value can't change the volume behind the operator's back. **FULLY FIELD-VERIFIED 2026-07-29/30 (Randy N4OPI): the command format, the read-back, and the dB figure itself all check out — he compared the Tab5's number against a QMX LCD side by side and they read identical.** Nothing about this path is unverified any more. Two behaviours he noted, both fine as they are: the QMX only prints the figure on its own LCD when its knob is clicked, and our slider samples the radio on drawer OPEN, so turning the rig's knob with the drawer already on screen doesn't move the slider until it's reopened (a live poll would have to skip refreshes while the knob is being dragged, or it would fight the operator's finger). Note the QMX remembers volume per band on its own; we store one fallback value, not per-band.

### The settings dirty set is a bit-INDEX array now, not a mask (widened 2026-07-29)
It was a `uint64_t` bitmask and it filled up completely — bit 21, the last free one, went to `DIRTY_QMX_VOL` in v1.3.3, so the next setting that wanted to persist simply couldn't. `s_dirty` in `storage/settings.c` is now `dirty_t`, a `DIRTY_WORDS`(4)×32 word array = **128 bits, 62 spare**; grow it by changing that one number. A wider integer was never an option: riscv32 GCC has no `__int128`.

**Every `DIRTY_*` is now a plain bit INDEX, not a mask — never write `dirty & DIRTY_X`.** Use `dirty_test()` / `dirty_set()` / `dirty_clear_bit()` / `dirty_any()` / `dirty_test_any()`. Because the set is a struct, the old bitwise spelling is a *compile error* rather than a silently-always-false test — that property is what made converting 65 call sites in one pass safe, and it's why the type must stay a struct even if it ever holds exactly one word. All 64 original indices were preserved unchanged (the map is runtime-only, nothing in NVS depends on it, but keeping them made the diff reviewable). The old `DIRTY_CONFIG_EXPORT_MASK` is now the `s_config_export_bits[]` index list + `dirty_test_any()`.

Unchanged rules: the LoTW `state`/`county` fields still **share** `DIRTY_LOTW_DXCC`, not because bits are scarce but because those three are only ever written together (the `/api/lotw_cert` handler and config import) — a slider, which moves on its own, needs its own bit. Anything added to `config_io_export()` must also join `s_config_export_bits[]` or the SD config mirror goes stale.

### A completed QSO is not necessarily finished on the OTHER side (v1.3.4)
Field-reported by Roy KI0ER working VE3INB: VE3INB never decoded our closing `R73`, so he kept sending `KI0ER VE3INB R-10` waiting for it, while we logged the QSO and moved on to the next CQ — he never got the final and Roy never made his log. Nothing could act on that: `resume_*`'s comeback record is deliberately **erased** at completion (so a fading partner can't be auto-resumed into a duplicate), and a `DONE` QSO is otherwise finished.

Fix, in `ft8_qso.c`: `final_resend_if_still_asked()` runs at the TOP of `ft8_qso_advance()`, before the pileup/CQ/IDLE handlers, and returns early so the slot belongs to finishing the previous QSO rather than starting the next. `partner_still_awaiting_final()` counts only a message addressed to us whose third field is a report or R-report — `RR73`/`73`/`RRR` mean they DID hear us. Bounded by `FINAL_RESEND_MAX` (3) inside `FINAL_RESEND_WINDOW_SEC` (240). It builds+arms ONE request directly and deliberately does **not** touch `s_state`/`s_cur_req`, so an armed CQ resumes by itself on the next `on_tx_complete()` re-arm.

**Also fixed with it: duplicate ADIF records.** The log is written at exactly one place (`WAIT_DONE -> DONE`), but that state is legitimately re-entered when the operator finishes by hand (`ft8_qso_notify_manual_final()`), which is where Roy's duplicates came from. Guarded on call + ADIF band + `QSO_DUP_LOG_WINDOW_SEC` (600). The band comparison uses the newly exported `adif_log_band_for_freq()` — do NOT reimplement the band table locally, or the guard can disagree with the log it's reasoning about.

⚠ The re-send budget is a judgement about on-air conduct and is sim-verified only; if field reports say 3-in-4-minutes is wrong, those two macros are the knobs.

### Never fabricate a signal report in the ADIF log (v1.3.4)
`adif_log.c` used to substitute `"599"` for an unknown `RST_SENT`/`RST_RCVD`. Roy KI0ER found it in his own log and asked whether stations really were sending him 599 — they weren't. In CW/SSB that's a harmless convention; in an FT8 log it's a **fabricated measurement that gets uploaded to QRZ, eQSL and LoTW as if real**. Both fields are now **omitted** when empty (ADIF requires neither, LoTW ignores both), every `"599"` placeholder in `ft8_qso.c` is `""`, and the ADIF viewer shows `-`. Don't reintroduce a placeholder for a value that was never exchanged.

**The same rule settled the chase-reference lookup, 2026-08-10 (v1.8.0).** `spots_activation_for_call()` (`net/spots.c`) matches the spotted callsign **EXACTLY**, and a base-callsign fallback was proposed and **rejected by the operator**. It would have recovered real credit — every SOTA spot carries a portable suffix (16 of 16 in a live sample), so a station spotted as `EA2GM/P` and worked as `EA2GM` logs no reference at all. But `EA2GM` at home and `EA2GM/P` on a summit are the same operator in different places, so a loose match can write a summit into a QSO that never was one, and upload it as fact. **A missing field is honest; a wrong one is not.** Don't add the fallback.

Related, and worth knowing before "improving" any of this: `ft8_qso.c` is the **only** writer of ADIF records, so the log holds FT8/FT4 contacts and nothing else. SOTA is almost entirely CW/SSB (0 of 16 spots in a digi mode), so `SIG=SOTA` is nearly unreachable in practice — the SOTA source earns its place as the **spectrum lane**, not as chase logging. The reachable case for the SIG rule is a DX-cluster-sourced spot whose reference is a summit or a WWFF site, worked on FT8: that used to be filed as `SIG=POTA`, a claim nobody could match, and `net/spot_sig.c` now decides it from the reference's shape (covered by `test/spot_sig_harness.c` — which links the real function rather than mirroring it).

### The ADIF file and the LoTW upload disagree about FT4 ON PURPOSE (v1.9.6)
ADIF is asymmetric: **FT8 is a MODE, FT4 is only a SUBMODE of MFSK.** So
`adif_log.c` writes FT4 as `MODE=MFSK` + `SUBMODE=FT4` (what WSJT-X writes, and
what ADIFMaster demands — it refuses to open a file declaring FT4 as a mode at
all, which is how Don Adams WB0LQW hit this while editing a log before
submitting it). POTA accepted the old `MODE=FT4`, and eQSL was quietly remapping
it for us.

⛔ **LoTW has no MFSK mode of its own** — TQSL's config maps (ADIF mode, ADIF
submode) pairs onto LoTW's own mode list, and MFSK appears only on the ADIF side
of that map. We sign our own TQ8s instead of handing an ADIF to TQSL, so the
collapse is ours to do: `lotw_mode_from_adif()` (portable, in `lotw_tq8.c`,
8 cases in `test/lotw_harness.c`, mutation-tested) turns the pair back into
`FT4`. **The invariant is byte identity** — an ADIF fix made for POTA and
ADIFMaster must not change one byte of the verified LoTW path. Anything else
reading `MODE` out of a record (`adif_view_modal.c`, the web log table) shows the
SUBMODE when there is one, because "MFSK" names a family, not the mode worked.

⚠ **The legacy duplicate-SUBMODE migration nearly ate this.**
`repair_legacy_submode_field()` swept the whole file for `<SUBMODE:3>FT4` (a
2026-06-30 fix for records that wrote SUBMODE as a copy of MODE, which QRZ
rejects). Unscoped, it would have stripped the new, CORRECT submode off every
record at the next boot — silently, and only visible in a file the operator
uploads. It is now line-scoped and fires only when `MODE == SUBMODE`. Whenever a
migration deletes a field by name, ask what else could legitimately carry that
name later.

⚠ **The FT4 half is NOT device-verified.** `ft8_sim.c`'s phantoms never engage in
FT4 (`schedule_cq_answer()` hardcodes `our_slot + 15`, TODO #256), so no FT4 QSO
could be logged on the bench with the radio wedged. FT8 records, the
`STATION_CALLSIGN` rename and the whole Park-to-Park path WERE verified on
hardware.

### Only what was EXCHANGED is editable — and `SIG` is derived, never typed (v1.9.6)
`POST /api/adif/edit` takes `RST_SENT`, `RST_RCVD` and `SIG_INFO`, and refuses
everything else with a 400. The boundary is not squeamishness: CALL, BAND, MODE,
QSO_DATE and TIME_ON are what QRZ, eQSL and LoTW match a contact on, and a LoTW
record is signed over exactly those — delete and re-log is the correct route for
those. `SIG`/`SIG_INFO` are read by POTA and SOTA for credit and by nothing that
matches a QSO, so they sit on the safe side of it.

**`SIG` is decided from the reference's shape** by `spot_sig_for_ref()` — the same
function that decides it for a chase logged off a spot, exported rather than
copied — so a typed programme cannot contradict the reference beside it, and it
is cleared when the reference is cleared. **A reference must contain a dash**:
`US1241` is refused rather than written, because the value goes out as a claim
that a specific park was worked. Same rule as never fabricating a signal report —
a missing field is honest, a wrong one is not.

`adif_log_set_field()` also got the verify-before-commit fix `delete_record()`
got in v1.9.5 (`ferror`, then `fflush`/`fsync`, then `fclose`, and only then
replace the file). It was the same latent bug, and this path is now used for a
whole activation's worth of records rather than the occasional report typo.

### Tone occupancy is filtered by slot PARITY (v1.3.4)
Roy KI0ER: "a frequency offset could be entirely available to me, but only if I TX into the correct time window." `build_tone_occupancy()` (`ft8_tx.c`) counted every decoded station regardless of the slot it was heard in, so a tone busy only in the OPPOSITE window read as busy for us — on a crowded band, most of the strip — and `ft8_find_clear_tone_hz_near()` steered away from slots that were in fact free.

Stations whose parity differs from ours are now skipped, using the same nearest-slot rounding as the decode list's E/O column (a bare `/period` truncation flips the parity of anything logged a hair before its slot). Our parity is only knowable via `ft8_tx_get_parity_lock()` — something armed or running; a reply inherits the opposite of theirs, a CQ carries the `TXCQ EVEN/ODD` choice. With `TXCQ ANY` or nothing armed there is no answer, so the mask stays the **union** of both windows. `*n_stations_out` still counts ALL heard stations on purpose: it answers "is the picture known at all", which drives the UI's all-grey "nothing heard yet" state.

### CW transmit offset is SPLIT, because the QMX has no XIT (v1.6.0, Roy KI0ER)
Roy KI0ER (#176143) asked for a "not zero-beat CW reply" offset: everyone answering a CW CQ zero-beat arrives as one mud-pit, and a QRP station 400–600 Hz off stands out. His manual workaround was the full VFO A/B dance on the radio's own controls.

**There is no XIT to use.** The QMX CAT manual is explicit — `IF;`'s XIT status field is *"always 0 because QMX has no XIT"*. So the offset is implemented as **split**: RX on VFO A, TX on VFO B, with `FB` held at `FA + offset` and `SP1;` on. **`FB`, `FR`, `FT` and `SP` all exist in 1_03_000 as well as 1_04** (checked command-by-command against both cached manuals), so this needs **no `cat_qmx_fw_at_least()` gate** — unlike AM/Tune. Only `RC`/`RR`/`IF` are 1_04-only.

**It lives in `poll_task` (`cw_split_maintain()` in `cat.c`), not in `cat_set_frequency()`.** Two reasons, and the second is the feature: the poll task owns the CDC pipe and this needs two extra writes; and maintaining it there makes the offset follow **every** way the frequency can move — panadapter tap, spot click, memory recall, band change, web UI, *and the radio's own tuning knob* — which is precisely Roy's "change frequency to another station, don't touch anything else, and the offset follows". A hook on our own tune path would have missed the knob.

Rules encoded in the maintainer, each one load-bearing:
- **CW/CW-R only** (`s_last_mode_digit` `'3'`/`'7'`). Any other mode stands it down — an offset transmit in SSB or a digital mode is a mistake, not a courtesy. This is also what stops it leaking into an FT8 session.
- **Only clears split if WE engaged it** (`s_split_engaged`). An operator running their own split has not asked us to interfere.
- **Re-asserts `FB`+`SP1` every 30 s** (`CW_SPLIT_REFRESH_US`) as well as on every base-frequency change. A radio that dropped split on its own (band change, menu visit) would otherwise transmit on top of the DX — silently, which is the worst possible failure for this feature.
- `FA;` reports **VFO A**, which stays the RX frequency in split, so `s_last_freq_hz` needs no special-casing.

**Unverified, and it needs a human:** no CW contact has been made with it. The CAT round-trip is verifiable on the bench; "does the DX hear me 500 Hz up" is not. Also unknown: whether `SP` survives a QMX power cycle (the manual does not mark it session-only), so a Tab5 powered off mid-CW may leave the radio in split — the operator sees it on the radio's own display, but it is worth a line in the manual.

### RIT is real on the QMX — but `RU`/`RD` are absolute OR relative depending on a menu setting
Unlike XIT, which the QMX does not have at all (hence the CW transmit offset's split dance), RIT exists in **both 1_03 and 1_04** — `RT` mode, `RU`/`RD` offset, `RC` clear. No firmware gate needed.

⚠ **The trap:** the CAT manual says `RU`/`RD` either set the offset absolutely or move it relatively, depending on the QMX System Config setting **"CAT RU and RD"** — which we cannot read and have no business changing. So every write in `cat.c` sends **`RC;` first** (clear to zero, unambiguous in both firmwares) and **then one `RU`/`RD`**, which lands on exactly the requested value under either setting. **Never send `RU`/`RD` without the `RC`.**

We own the value (`cat_get_rit_hz()`) rather than polling `IF;` for it — the display needs it every frame, and a poll would be both slower and a fifth competitor for the pipe.

**Display compensation lives in `ui_get_if_offset_hz()`** (`total_hz -= cat_get_rit_hz()`), the one documented place defining which baseband frequency the dial maps to, so signals stand still and the marker shows where you are listening. ⚠ **The sign is DERIVED, not verified on a signal** — there is no antenna on the bench. The falsifying test is one steady carrier: engage RIT +200 and the trace must NOT move (a jump of 400 Hz means the sign is inverted). The comment in that function carries the reasoning and the test.

**Tap-to-RIT forces a 10 Hz snap regardless of mode** (`touch_event_cb`'s PRESSING branch). The mode grid exists to land the DIAL tidily; SSB's 250 Hz would leave five usable offsets inside ±500 and DiGi's 500 Hz would leave three. The cursor is drawn from the same snap, so the marker lands where the line was.

**Retuning clears RIT**, inside `cat_set_frequency()` so every path is covered (tap, spot, memory recall, band change, web), and `ui_rit_notify_retune()` stands the armed mode down with it — otherwise the operator's next tap would silently set an offset instead of tuning.

### RF gain (`RG`) is per band and NOT session-only — commit on release, never store a copy
Stan's suggestion via Samuel W7STF. `RG;` gets, `RG<nnn>;` sets, in **plain dB** — range 0–99, default 54 (operation manual: *"RF gain (dB): 54 is the default. Valid values for the parameter are 0 to 99"*). Present in 1_03 and 1_04.

Three traps, all different from the `AG` volume slider it sits next to:
- **`RG` is plain dB; `AG` is 0.25 dB steps.** The two commands look alike and are scaled differently. Sending dB to `AG` sets a quarter of what was asked.
- **It is per BAND.** So the Tab5 stores **nothing** — no NVS key, no config-export field. It reads back on drawer open (and on every `/api/settings` GET) and shows "reading..." until the radio answers. A remembered value would belong to whichever band the operator was on last, and replaying it would silently reconfigure the current one.
- **It is not marked session-only** in the CAT manual, and it edits the same figure as the Band Configuration terminal app — i.e. a write changes the operator's *stored* configuration. Hence the drawer slider commits on `LV_EVENT_RELEASED` and only moves its label on `VALUE_CHANGED`; a drag must not stream sixty writes into stored config.

Changing it moves the noise floor the panadapter is calibrated against, so both the drawer and the web path call `ui_flat_mode_reset()`.

### "Release radio" (operator pause) — and why the watchdogs had to learn about it
Stan's second suggestion, and it is not merely a convenience. The QMX's own menu **and its Terminal Applications (Band Configuration)** speak over the *same* CDC pipe we poll `FA;`/`MD;`/`FW;` on every 50 ms, so anything the operator does on the radio is being interrupted continuously. This is also the leading hypothesis for Samuel W7STF's "odd behaviour changing Band config on the QMX+ while the panadapter runs" (#176112, thread not yet read — groups.io needs auth).

`cat_user_pause_set()` / `cat_user_pause_active()`. **Deliberately a separate flag from `s_poll_paused`**: that one belongs to the FT8 TX burst and is cleared at the end of *every* burst, which would silently cancel the operator's pause.

**Three things stand down together, and forgetting any one of them would have been worse than not having the button:**
1. the CAT poll (the point of the exercise);
2. the **dead-stream watchdog** (`audio.c`) — a deliberate menu visit produces its exact signature (UAC open, CAT alive, zero audio pairs), and at 120 s it would have cut VBUS under the operator's hands;
3. the **stuck-decode watchdog** (`ft8_test.c`) — every slot decodes zero while paused, by design.

Resume re-runs the IQ handshake and re-seeds the flat floor. UI: a calm blue banner (not warning-red — nothing is wrong, the operator asked for this), tappable to resume, plus the drawer button and `/api/cmd {"action":"pause"|"resume"}` with `paused` in `/api/status`. **The banner is not decoration**: while paused the spectrum freezes and the decode list empties, which is visually identical to the fault Roy KI0ER reported, so the screen has to say unprompted that this state was asked for and how to leave it.

### The QMX's FRONT-PANEL menus are not isolated from CAT — and the failure is a radio REBOOT (thread #176111, 2026-08-07)
Samuel W7STF reproduced it precisely on a QMX+ (1.004.03): with the panadapter running, enter the front-panel **Band config** menu and turn the VOL encoder one click to change band → the LCD blanks, backlight off → "Starting processes" → the radio is back at VFO A having restarted. Current draw jumps 0.110 A → 0.180 A. **With USB unplugged it does not happen. Via PuTTY (the terminal menu) it does not happen.**

**Stan Dye KC7XE's analysis, which we should treat as the working model** (he has the deepest QMX-internals knowledge in that thread):
- The blank + "Starting processes" is **Hans's watchdog reset** — the firmware auto-reboots when the SMPS control loop gets stuck. So the radio genuinely restarts; this is not a display glitch.
- The **terminal** menu is served over serial and is *well isolated* from the CAT control channel (two terminal sessions even lock each other out of the same menu). The **front-panel** menu is not: it needs the MCU driving the display, "a completely different I/O control loop, not nearly as well isolated from the CAT control channel".
- He believes it is specific CAT command **types**, not the poll rate or timing.
- ⚠ **"a somewhat similar issue happens if you enter the Tune SWR menu — in that menu ANY character sent over the CAT interface will lock up the radio controls."**

**This ties three of our own field reports into one mechanism.** Roy KI0ER (#176113) sees FT8 decodes go blank after changing *any* QMX menu item (he used TX-power display type), staying blank "until I restart the QMX radio". Put that next to two facts already in this file — `Q9` IQ mode is **session state**, and a QMX restart with the cable connected **often fires no USB disconnect event at all** (see "QMX power cycle doesn't always re-enumerate USB") — and the whole thing follows: the menu visit trips the watchdog reset, the QMX reboots, IQ mode is wiped, the USB link survives, so **CAT answers normally while no audio arrives**. That is exactly the dead-stream signature, and it is why only a manual QMX restart appeared to fix it (it forced a re-enumeration and a fresh handshake).

**Prediction worth testing on hardware:** the v1.6.0 dead-stream watchdog's new 30 s `Q9 1;` re-assert should now recover Roy's case *automatically*, without the audio reset or the USB replug. If a field log shows `dead stream: 30 s ... re-asserting IQ mode` followed by decodes resuming, that confirms both this model and the fix.

✅ **RESOLVED 2026-08-09 — our own Antenna Tune is NOT affected (Stan KC7XE, asked directly).** The concern was that `tune_modal.c` / `web_tune_start()` enter SWR Tune with `MD8;` and then poll **`PC;SW;` continuously while the radio transmits** (`cat_tune_poll_set_active(true)`), with `MD;` still rotating — i.e. straight into the "any CAT character locks the radio" hazard, if that hazard applied to the CAT-entered mode. It does not: *"This only happens when using the front panel menu to activate Tune SWR. I just tested a few CAT commands, and they work fine while Tune SWR is invoked using `MD8;`."* So the lock-up is a property of the **front-panel menu**, matching Stan's model above (the front-panel menu shares the MCU's display I/O loop and is poorly isolated from the CAT channel; the terminal menu and CAT-entered modes are not). Our poll stands as-is, unchanged. TODO #95 closed.

**This also weakens the Dirk DK7CVD link.** This file records his crash arriving "specifically after using the QMX's SWR Tune submenu then power-cycling" — that was the radio's own *submenu*, not our `MD8;` path, so it is consistent with Stan's front-panel finding and is **not** evidence against our Tune button. Dirk's crash was in any case root-caused separately to the CDC disconnect race (see that section above), which is fixed.

⚠ Still untested on a dummy load: the live W/SWR figures themselves, and whether restoring the prior mode digit cleanly exits the radio's Tune UI (`docs/qmx-1_04-cat-comparison.md` §5). Stan's answer clears the *safety* question, not the *correctness* one.

**What this does NOT justify:** slowing or restructuring our poll. Stan's own reading is that rate is not the issue, and every previous "obvious cause" in this file has been wrong when measured. The shipped answer is the **"Release radio" pause** — which is precisely what Stan independently asked for in the same thread: *"there is no way for the Tab5 to know what menus you are going into - so it would be good to have a 'pause button' on Tab5 for when you want to interact with menus which change the configuration of the radio."*

Also from that thread, and the reason Samuel was in Band config at all: he was adjusting **RF gain to match band conditions**. Stan: RF gain "should be a static setting" in the band table, and `RG;` "should be used for that purpose for on-the-fly changes (and ideally should be accessible via Tab5)" — which is what the RF-gain slider above now provides, removing the reason to open that menu mid-session.

### IQ mode is SESSION state — re-assert it before resetting anything (v1.6.0)
The QMX's `Q9` (IQ mode) is explicitly *"for the current operating session only and is not written to EEPROM"* — which is how a trip through the radio's own menu leaves the panadapter with a dead audio stream while CAT keeps answering perfectly. That is Roy KI0ER's blank-decode-list report, and the radio in that state is **not** broken: it simply is not being asked for IQ audio any more.

So `iq_mode_handshake(int max_attempts)` was extracted from `link_task` (`cat.c`) and is now callable on a live link via `cat_request_iq_reassert()`, drained by `poll_task` (which owns the pipe). The dead-stream watchdog's escalation gained it as a **new first step at 30 s**, ahead of the 60 s soft audio reset and the 120 s `usb_replug()`. Cheapest-first: it is free, invisible when IQ was already on, and it fixes the menu-visit case outright without touching the USB port. Resume-from-pause queues the same handshake.

### Cross-thread CAT writes must go through the poll task, not the LVGL thread
The poll task is the only thing that should write to the CDC pipe at runtime. Writing a CAT/MM command directly from the LVGL/UI thread (e.g. a touch handler) races the `FA;`/`MD;`/`FW;` poll on the same pipe; the two commands interleave and the QMX gets a garble and returns `?;`, so the write lands only intermittently. Pattern: stash the request in a `volatile` and let `poll_task` drain it on its next cycle (see `s_pending_ssb_bw` / `cat_request_ssb_bandwidth()` in `cat.c`). FT8 TX uses the other valid approach — `cat_poll_set_paused(true)` for the burst's whole duration.

### SSB filter bandwidth needs THREE coordinated writes (the hard-won recipe)
Setting the QMX SSB RX filter (2500/2700/2900/3200 Hz) from the panadapter took a long debug to pin down. The QMX exposes the SSB filter as **two separate Menu-Manager items** plus a Kenwood read, none of which is sufficient alone:

- **`MMSSB|Filter RX=<hz>;`** — the *committed* value. Persists, shows in the QMX SSB menu (alongside `Filter TX`), but on its own does **not** reload the live filter, so you hear no change.
- **`MMSSB|Bandwidth=<hz>;`** — the *live/active* filter. Applies immediately (you see the passband widen), but on its own the QMX reverts it to the committed value.
- **`FW;` poll** — reads the *active* filter width; **the act of reading it makes the QMX re-assert a stale active width**, snapping any change back. (Proved by freezing the poll for 2 s: the filter holds, then snaps back the instant polling resumes.)

The working recipe (`poll_task` drain of `s_pending_ssb_bw`, set via `cat_request_ssb_bandwidth()`): write **`Filter RX`** (persist) **and** `Bandwidth` (apply live) to the same value, **and** while a width is pinned (`s_ssb_bw_pinned`) and mode is USB/LSB, **drop `FW;` from the poll rotation** so nothing reverts it. The BW label is driven optimistically from the user's selection (`ui_update_passband_width()` in `bw_preset_cb`). Trade-off: while pinned, a filter change made on the radio's own knob won't show on the Tab5 until you switch modes (FW; resumes in CW). ⚠ **The pin is NEVER cleared**, so coming back CW -> SSB the suppression turns straight on again and nothing would repaint the label - it kept the CW width (Samuel W7STF saw 50 Hz in LSB, #214). `cat.c` now repaints from the pin on that transition; do NOT "fix" it by clearing the pin and re-reading, because a bare `FW;` makes the radio revert the live filter, which is the whole reason the pin exists.

Dead ends recorded so MM-token guessing isn't repeated: `MMSSB|Filter RX` *write* alone = persists but silent; `MMSSB|Bandwidth` *write* alone = audible but reverts; Kenwood `FW<nnnn>;` *set* = QMX returns `?;`; re-asserting the **same** mode digit (`MD2` while already USB) does **not** reload the filter (only a *different* mode does, which is why the old CW-bounce "worked" but flickered CW/50 Hz). CW (`MMCW|CW passband=`) commits cleanly on its own and is left untouched.

## Diagnostic logging (v0.15.11, made always-on in v0.19.x)

Field-diagnostics capture for remote bug reports. **Always-on as of v0.19.x** — there is no longer a settings-drawer toggle or NVS switch (the old `diag_log` NVS setting, `settings_set_diag_log()`, and `DRAWER_SEC_DIAG` were all removed as dead code); `diag_log_init()` enables capture unconditionally from the very first boot log (`s_enabled = (s_ring != NULL)` in `diag_log.c`). The bottom-bar static green dot (`s_bot_diag_dot` in `ui.c`) now indicates the **SD-backup mounted** state, unrelated to logging — see "Diagnostic log persistence (RAM ring → flash → SD)" above for the always-on ring + flash + SD persistence layers.

- `diag_log_init()` (called first thing in `app_main`, before any subsystem init) installs an `esp_log_set_vprintf` hook that captures **all** ESP_LOG output into a **5 MB PSRAM ring buffer** (`DIAG_RING_CAP`) and always forwards to the serial console (passthrough — serial output is unchanged).
- `cat.c` emits gated per-line **CAT RX** (`RX<- ...;`) at INFO so they're captured (INFO is always compiled in; don't switch to `ESP_LOGD` — DEBUG may be compiled out). **Poll de-duplication is essential**: the FA/MD/FW poll runs every ~50 ms (~60 lines/s). `diag_log_rx()` drops identical consecutive FA/MD/FW poll responses (logs them only on *change*; the `Freq=/Mode=/Passband=` change-logs already mark transitions), and the poll TX is not logged per-line — only a `poll heartbeat` line every 10 s. One-off writes (`Sent:`/`SSB filter ->`/`raw cmd:`) and all non-poll RX (MM, VN, ID, ?;, garbles) are logged in full. Net steady-state: ~0 lines/s + a heartbeat, so the 5 MB ring comfortably holds a whole session.
- Extraction paths: **web** `GET /api/log` (live ring) and `GET /api/log/saved` (flash-persisted copy that survives a reboot) — both behind the one bottom-bar item **Files -> "Diagnostic download ↓"**, which downloads them as `qmx-log.txt` + `qmx-log-saved.txt` (the separate "Diag ↓"/"Diag(saved) ↓" buttons are gone); and **USB serial** (`tools/capture_serial_log.ps1`, works with no WiFi — the Travis case).
- The enable header logs Tab5 fw (`esp_app_get_description()`), `qmx_fw=` (from `VN;`), and build stamp, so every captured log is self-identifying.
- Ring concurrency: short spinlock for appends (lines come from a 256-byte stack buffer, so the critical section is tiny); the snapshot copies **without** the lock (head/count grabbed under it) to avoid a long interrupts-off window — worst case a few oldest bytes garble mid-copy, acceptable for a diagnostic dump. Never take a blocking lock in the vprintf hook (runs pre-scheduler and from arbitrary contexts).
- **`reset_reason` is ambiguous on this hardware.** The header logs `esp_reset_reason()`, but a deliberate reset-button force-off on the Tab5 comes back as `panic/exception`, not `external-pin`/`power-on`. So that value alone does **not** prove a software crash. Historically the only reliable tell was a `Guru Meditation` / register+backtrace dump in the log immediately *before* the reboot — and **that dump was never on the device** (see below), so in practice a field crash could not be confirmed at all.

### A crash now SURVIVES the reboot — read the record, don't hunt for a backtrace (#117, 2026-08-20)
`util/panic_hook.c` wraps `esp_panic_handler` (`-Wl,--wrap=`), stashes a compact
record in **RTC no-init RAM**, and `panic_hook_report_previous()` logs it from
`app_main` right after `diag_log_init()`. So the **next** boot's log carries
`=== THE PREVIOUS BOOT CRASHED ===` with the reason, the assert/abort text, the
**task name**, the uptime it died at, MEPC/MTVAL/MCAUSE/RA/SP, and a ready-made
`addr2line` command. It reaches `/api/log` **and** `/api/log/saved`.

**This retires the standing "only a serial capture catches a crash" rule for the
common case.** Before it, a field crash left nothing: verified 2026-08-14 that
`/api/log/saved`, the SD log and a 5 MB SD archive back to 26 July held **zero**
asserts and **zero** register dumps, while the serial capture held both of that
night's. Ask an operator for a diagnostic download now and the crash is in it.

⚠ **A valid record is also POSITIVE proof the reset was a real crash**, which
`reset_reason` can never be here. `panic/exception` with **no** record = a forced
power-off or a flash.

**Why it does NOT flush to flash from the handler**, which is the obvious design
and the one the TODO proposed: a panic handler runs with interrupts off, the
other core halted and possibly no cache, so a SPIFFS write there can **hang
instead of rebooting** — turning a diagnosable crash into a dead device. It also
cannot take diag_log's spinlock or run the 30 s persist task. RTC RAM survives
every warm reset, and every panic reset is warm.

⚠ **Deliberate limitation:** RTC RAM does **not** survive a full power cycle, so
a crash followed by pulling the battery is still lost. The serial capture remains
the record for that, and for anything that hangs without panicking.

**`{"action":"panic_test"}`** crashes on demand so the mechanism stays
**falsifiable** — a hook that never fires looks exactly like the bug it fixes
(the #189 lesson). ⚠ Radio-OFF only: a panic reboot is a warm reset, i.e. the
documented **#74** trigger. Verified end to end on 2026-08-20 — the wrap was
confirmed in the **disassembly**, and the recorded PC decoded to the exact
`abort()` line.

## Tab5 snap-on keyboard (optional)

The M5Stack Tab5 70-key snap-on keyboard (SKU A164) is an **STM32F030C8T6 acting as an I2C slave at 0x6D on its own bus: SDA=GPIO0, SCL=GPIO1** (a C port of M5Stack's `M5Tab5-Keyboard-UserDemo`; reference copy + protocol notes in `docs/tab5-keyboard-ref/`). It is **not** the TCA8418 at 0x34 that an earlier abandoned attempt assumed — that bug was looking at the wrong chip on a bus (SYS GPIO31/32, EXT GPIO53/54) that the keyboard isn't even on.

`keyboard/tab5_keyboard.c` creates a dedicated I2C master on **port 1** (the EXT controller, otherwise unused by us — SYS is port 0), probes 0x6D, and on success puts the keyboard in **String mode** (`reg 0x10 = 2`): the STM32 does the keymap + shift/symbol-layer handling and returns ready ASCII, so we never need a row/col→char table. A 50 ms poll task (no GPIO50 IRQ in v1) reads `INT_STA (0x01)` bit2, then drains events from `EVENT_NUM (0x02)` / `CHAR_EVENT_LEN (0x40)` / `CHAR_EVENT_BASE (0x50)`. If no keyboard answers, it scans the bus, logs the result, and disables itself — harmless on units with no keyboard.

**Special keys arrive as a spelled-out NAME token, not a control code** (`esc`, `tab`, `left`/`right`/`up`/`down`, `del`, `enter`, `backspace`) — and **casing is inconsistent** from the firmware (`ENTER` upper, `esc`/`backspace` lower), so all token matches use `strcasecmp`. Discriminator in `kbd_text_cb` (ui.c): `strlen==1` → literal character; otherwise → named-key lookup (unknown names are ignored, never typed). Modifier keys (Shift/Fn/Sym/Ctrl/Alt) emit **no event** — applied inside the MCU.

UI bridge (in `ui.c`, runs on the keyboard task — takes `display_lock()` before any LVGL call):
- char → `lv_textarea_add_char` on the focused field; backspace/del → delete; arrows → cursor move.
- **tab** → `kbd_focus_next_field()` cycles textareas sharing the active field's parent panel (no per-modal wiring).
- **enter** → click the modal's Save button; **esc** → click Cancel. Each modal registers these via `ui_kbd_set_buttons(save,cancel)` (declared in `ui_theme.h`, auto-cleared on button `LV_EVENT_DELETE`); wired in all six modals (wifi/identity/cq/filter/time/memory). Enter/Esc work even with no field focused (the time-set modal has no textarea).
- Focus tracking (`s_kbd_ta`) is centralised in `ui_theme_style_textarea()` (FOCUSED/DEFOCUSED/DELETE events), so every styled textarea is a keyboard target automatically.
- **Freq keypad** has no textarea: when `freq_keypad_is_open()`, digits/`.` route to `freq_apply_key()`, backspace→'D', enter→'E' (set freq), esc→'C' (cancel).

`KB_DEBUG_BYTES` in `tab5_keyboard.c` (default 0) logs every event's raw payload — flip to 1 to discover tokens for any new special keys.

## RTC and time sync (v0.15.17)

`rtc/rtc.c` — thin driver for the Epson RX8130CE on I2C 0x32 (SYS bus, 400 kHz). Supercap 70,000 µF/3.3V gives ~30–40 h time retention. Registers 0x10–0x16 (SEC…YEAR, all BCD). Flag register 0x1D bit 0x80 = VBLF (power failure / low voltage).

`time_sync/time_sync.c` — global orchestrator. Init sequence:
1. `rtc_init()` — adds I2C device, runs M5Unified begin() sequence (bitOn 0x1F, clear 0x30/0x1E), reads and validates all BCD registers. VBLF=0 is **not** sufficient: an uninitialised chip has VBLF=0 but garbage registers. `rtc_get_time()` rejects any field out of range (sec>59, hour>23, year not 2000–2100) and marks invalid.
2. If RTC valid → `rtc_apply_to_system()` sets system clock immediately at boot via `mktime()` (safe: ESP-IDF newlib uses UTC timezone by default, so `mktime() == timegm()`).
3. Spawns `time_sync_task`: waits 15 s (head start for ft8_task), then waits for CAT ready (up to 5 min), queries `TM;` once on CAT connect, then loops every 5 min — catches QMX GPS lock events.

**QMX time-of-day only (no date):** `time_sync_notify_qmx(h, m, s)` reconstructs full UTC from the best available date anchor: system clock (if sane), NVS `last_unix_time`, or `EPOCH_SANE_MIN` (2023-11-14) as last resort. Both bounds are checked — stale anchors in the past AND garbage future values (>2040) are rejected. Date doesn't matter for FT8 (86400 % 15 == 0, so any day base gives the correct slot parity). NVS is only updated when the computed epoch is within sane bounds, preventing NVS poisoning from a garbage anchor.

**Sync priority (highest first):**
1. SNTP — always authoritative when WiFi is up; always sets system clock, RTC, and NVS
2. Tab5 RTC — applied immediately at boot before QMX/SNTP are up
3. QMX TM; — offline/POTA fallback only; only sets system clock when SNTP has NOT synced within `SNTP_FRESH_MS` (10 min in `time_sync.c`); ignored while SNTP is active
4. Manual — `time_sync_set_manual()`, always applies (rare POTA with no SNTP or QMX)

Non-GPS QMX: the QMX internal RTC drifts freely (no GPS). Trusting it above SNTP would break FT8 timing. Prior design had QMX dominating SNTP (`QMX_DOMINATES_SNTP_MS`) which was wrong for non-GPS units. Fixed in v0.16.0: SNTP always wins; QMX is only the fallback when offline. Each accepted sync still writes through to the RX8130CE so the clock persists across power-off.

**ft8_test.c** `set_time_from_qmx_rtc()` delegates to `time_sync_notify_qmx()` — no separate logic.

## dBm calibration

`DSP_DB_CALIBRATION_OFFSET = -148.0 dB` (measured on dummy load, noise floor → -130 dBm). S9 = -73 dBm. Display range: -130 to -30 dBm.

### The QMX makes its own spurs, and the fix is to MOVE THE LO, not to filter

⛔ **THE SPUR MAP MOVES THE OPERATOR'S DIAL, SO IT IS A SECOND WRITER OF THE
RADIO - AND THAT COST A FIELD FAULT (John W5JSS, 2026-09-19).** Three separate
bugs, all from one assumption: that the frequency it was handed is still the
frequency the radio is on.

- **It ran on the WSPR and FT8 pages.** A measurement begun on the panadapter
  was still running when he opened WSPR; the WSPR dial push landed and the spur
  map then "restored" the OLD frequency over it. His QMX sat on **14.074 while
  WSPR believed 14.0956** - it heard nothing, and a burst would have gone out on
  the FT8 frequency while the spot named 14.0956. Gated to
  `UI_MODE_PANADAPTER` now, in `spur_task` AND in `safe_to_dither()`. Not
  relevant is literal: `fft_task` takes the IQ-capture branch in those modes and
  never reaches `spur_map_apply()`, so the suppression does nothing there and
  there is nothing to pay 25 Hz for.
- **`grab_average()` takes SECONDS**, so the dial must be re-read before each of
  the two writes, never carried from the argument.
- ⭐⭐ **A "FORCED" FREQUENCY WRITE CAN STILL BE DEFERRED, AND IT RETURNS
  `ESP_OK`.** This is the general one and it is not about spurs.
  `cat_set_frequency_forced()` is forced against the **200 ms rate limiter**
  only; if a burst owns the pipe the write is parked in `s_pending_freq_hz` and
  sent seconds later. Measured: the nudge was deferred, the restore went out
  **first**, and the nudge landed 7 s afterwards, leaving the radio 25 Hz high -
  precisely what that code's own "always restore, FORCED" comment claimed to
  prevent. **Anything that writes a frequency it intends to take back must ask
  `cat_poll_is_paused()` first and withdraw with
  `cat_cancel_pending_freq_if()`** (value-matched, so it can only cancel its own
  write and never an operator band change in the same one-slot queue).

⚠ **Two things the bench taught that reasoning did not.** A 1.5 s confirm window
gave three consecutive timeouts in the first 15 s of a boot, because the `FA`
poll was queued behind the twelve `MM` reads of the band table - the radio was
fine and the instrument was slow, so it is 3 s. And an **unconfirmed** nudge
must still be restored: the bytes went out, so the radio may be 25 Hz high and
merely not polled yet. Abandon the measurement, never the restore.

Measured 2026-08-13 with the **BNC open** (they are self-generated — no antenna needed to
reproduce any of this). At 14.074: teeth every **8015.6 Hz**, strongest **+38.6 dB** over
the noise floor, plus a 2nd harmonic and a mirror image ~9 dB down. The noise floor itself
is 5–6 dB worse at a bad frequency. **14.074 — the FT8 calling frequency — sits inside the
only bad window in 20 kHz.**

**The law:** spur offset = **multiplier × (dial − f0)**, aliased into ±24 kHz, multiplier
**per window** (16.0 and 23.0 solid over several intervals; others aliased at 500 Hz steps
and unreliable). Windows are 1–3 kHz wide, ~6 per 100 kHz. That sensitivity kills a
*stored* map (f0 would need ~3 Hz accuracy at ×16) and hands you detection for free: a
25 Hz nudge moves a spur 8–27 bins and a real signal half of one.

**Things that cost time here — do not re-derive them:**
- **Deep cancellation is an ACCURACY problem, not an averaging one.** A 0.37 dB error
  leaves a residual only 10.9 dB down. The ceiling is the spur's own ~0.5 dB wobble; a
  constant cannot cancel something that moves. The ±1 dB servo is NOT the limit (it settled
  at −0.11 dB with the bound opened to 6 dB).
- **Over-subtraction must clamp to the measured floor**, not to near-zero. Dropping a bin
  to 0.001× reads as a notch gouged into the display, which the operator spotted at once.
- **Interpolate needs a RAMP from references clear of the skirt.** One constant across a
  16-bin run gives a flat-topped block that looks like a saturated signal.
- **Selection must keep the STRONGEST bins, not the first found** — negative offsets are
  high indices, so first-found silently discarded the biggest spurs on the band.
- ⚠ **The ± pair asymmetry is NOT proven to be I/Q imbalance.** Symmetric AM/PM sidebands
  move together under a dial change exactly as an image would, so the sweep does not
  discriminate. I asserted, retracted and re-asserted this in one session — stop until
  there is a known single-sideband test signal. The operator's phantom-CW report on low
  bands stands on its own as evidence that image rejection is poor.

## I/Q balance correction

`dsp/iq_balance.c` — blind adaptive Gram-Schmidt orthogonaliser applied per sample in `audio.c` before samples enter the ring buffer.

- **DC removal**: exponential tracker, τ = 1 s
- **Power tracking** (I² and Q²): τ = 200 ms
- **Cross-product tracking** (I·Q): τ = 1 s
- **Two-speed startup** (Phase C): all alphas run at 8× for the first 2 s of signal after each reset, giving ~125 ms convergence; then drop to steady-state for stable long-term tracking
- **Correction**: `q_out = (q - K_phi·i) × K_amp`; I channel is unchanged
- **Toggle**: `iq_balance_set_enabled()` / `iq_balance_is_enabled()` — wired to the settings drawer switch (Phase B); re-enabling calls `iq_balance_reset()` so the estimator reconverges from clean state

Do not call `AI1;` on the QMX CAT port — it partially executes (enables auto-info mode) despite returning `?;`, which breaks FA polling for the entire session until power cycle.

## FT8 TX (v0.12.0) — key design points

`FT8_TX_SEND_LIVE = 1` in `ft8_tx.c` — this is live TX; the radio keys up for real.

- **CAT burst sequence**: `TX;` → 79× `TA<freq>;` at 160 ms cadence (absolute `esp_timer_get_time()` targets, no drift) → `TA0;` → 5 ms settle → `RX;`. Always runs the tail even on abort or error. **FT4 uses 105× `TA<freq>;` at 48 ms cadence**, burst ~5 s on-air vs ~12.7 s FT8. **FT4's tone spacing is ~20.833 Hz, NOT 6.25 Hz** — it is `1 / FT4_SYMBOL_PERIOD` (`FT4_TONE_SPACING_HZ` in `ft8_tx.c`), and 4-FSK rather than FT8's 8. The code has always been right; this line claimed 6.25 Hz until 2026-08-09. CAT cadence verified on real QMX hardware (v0.19.0): all commands sent cleanly with no timeouts or dropped tones.
- **Tone spacing**: 6.25 Hz per FT8 tone index (0–7). `freq = base_hz + tone * 6.25f`.
- **Slot parity**: `((unix_sec / 15) % 2) == 0` → EVEN. Reply fires on the opposite parity from the heard slot. CQ fires on any slot unless `use_parity=true` + `want_even_slot` set.
- **`cat_poll_set_paused(true/false)`** in `cat.c` — cooperative flag; TX burst holds this for its entire duration so the poll task doesn't interleave commands. Do **not** use `vTaskSuspend` — that can deadlock the CDC-ACM driver mutex.
- **Digi-mode pre-flight**: checked at arm time (blocking, ~1 s worst case); re-checked at burst time (cached string read, free). If mode has drifted at burst time, abort cleanly before `TX;` — never attempt a corrective switch at burst time (would desync slot start).
- **`ft8_find_clear_tone_hz()`**: heap-allocs a snapshot of the heard-station table, builds a `uint64_t` bitmask of occupied 50 Hz bins (200–2800 Hz, 52 slots), walks outward from bin 26 (1500 Hz) with ±1 guard, returns first clear bin in Hz. Returns `FT8_TX_CQ_DEFAULT_FREQ_HZ` (1500) on OOM or empty table. Generalized as `ft8_find_clear_tone_hz_near(center_hz)` (2026-06-26) — same scan, centred on an arbitrary tone instead of the fixed default, so a clash can be resolved by hopping to the *nearest* clear slot rather than only ever picking a fresh tone near 1500 Hz.
- **CQ tone auto-relocation (2026-06-26)**: clear-tone selection used to happen only once, at the moment Call CQ was pressed — `ft8_tx_is_clashing()` would flag "⚠ FREQ BUSY" if another station later drifted onto that tone, but CQ kept transmitting on it regardless, stepping on whoever was legitimately there. `ft8_qso.c`'s `relocate_cq_tone_if_clashing()`, called from the CQ no-answer path on every RX slot, now re-scans and hops `s_freq_hz`/`s_cur_req.audio_freq_hz` (and `s_cq_saved`, so a later timeout-resume-CQ keeps the new tone) to the nearest still-clear slot when a clash is detected, disarming and re-arming at the new frequency. Only applies to CQ between cycles — an active exchange's tone stays locked to the partner for the whole QSO, same as before.

### Touch-drag row selection (ft8_screen_view.c)

- `ROW_PREVIEW_MS = 80` — dim highlight appears after 80 ms so user sees which row is targeted.
- `ROW_HOLD_SELECT_MS = 250` — finger held ≥ 250 ms enters full selection mode (scroll locks, drag moves highlight).
- `ROW_SCROLL_CANCEL_PX = 20` — movement beyond 20 px before the gate fires cancels selection (generous for field/glove use).
- On threshold crossing: `lv_obj_clear_flag(s_list, LV_OBJ_FLAG_SCROLLABLE)` locks list scroll so drag moves the highlight rather than scrolling.
- On `RELEASED` or `PRESS_LOST`: `lv_obj_add_flag(s_list, LV_OBJ_FLAG_SCROLLABLE)` restores scroll unconditionally.
- `screen_y_to_row(abs_y)`: maps absolute screen Y to row index accounting for `s_list` coords and `lv_obj_get_scroll_y()`.

## FT8 QSO state machine — pounce + CQ-run (v0.13.0 / v0.15.0)

`ft8_qso.c` — one state machine, two roles. Driven by three call sites:
- `ft8_qso_start(tx1_req)` — LVGL task: pounce. Accepts a pre-built TX1 (`<them> <me> <grid>`), enters WAIT_RPT.
- `ft8_qso_start_cq(cq_req)` — LVGL task: CQ-run. Arms CQ, enters CQ.
- `ft8_qso_advance(slot_sec)` — **decode task** after each RX slot: scans `ft8_screen` for messages with `last_utc == slot_sec`, decides the next message.
- `ft8_qso_on_tx_complete()` — **capture task** right after each burst: re-arms the current outgoing message.

**Two role flows** (third field of the FT8 message decides):
```
POUNCE (we answered their CQ)          CQ-RUN (they answered our CQ)
 TX1 <them> <me> <grid>                 CQ  CQ <me> <grid>
 RX  <me> <them> <report>   WAIT_RPT     RX  <me> <them> <grid|rpt>   CQ
 TX2 <them> <me> R<report>               TX  <them> <me> <report>     (snr proxy)
 RX  <me> <them> RR73/73    WAIT_RR73    RX  <me> <them> R<report>    WAIT_ROGER
 TX3 <them> <me> 73                      TX  <them> <me> RR73
                            WAIT_DONE → (final fired, ft8_tx IDLE) → DONE → IDLE
```

**Patience / retry (v0.15.0)**: the *current outgoing message* (`s_cur_req`) is re-armed every TX slot by `on_tx_complete()` (CQ cadence + exchange retries), so we keep pushing the same call until progress. `QSO_TIMEOUT_SLOTS = 4` consecutive RX slots with no progress → give up. CQ-originated QSOs **resume CQ** on timeout (don't drop the frequency); pounce QSOs go sticky TIMEOUT.

**Deferred arming (v0.15.0)**: `advance()` runs in the decode task ~4 s into the *next* slot — usually while our re-armed burst is already ACTIVE, when `ft8_tx_arm()` refuses. So advance() only updates state + `s_cur_req`; `rearm_current()` (from `on_tx_complete()`, or `arm_current_if_idle()` as a safety net) does the actual arm. WAIT_DONE arms the final exactly once then clears `s_have_cur`. This fixes the v0.14.0 bug where a CQ reply detected during the next CQ burst could never transition out of CQ.

**Report value**: CQ-run sends a signal report built from the answering station's estimated SNR (`fmt_report`, clamped −24..+15, e.g. `-07`). SNR is computed in `ft8_estimate_snr_db()` (`ft8_test.c`) directly from the decoder's own FFT magnitudes — signal level (strongest of the 8 tone bins per symbol, averaged over the slot) minus the slot's mean noise floor, scaled from per-bin bandwidth to WSJT-X's 2500 Hz reference. Self-calibrating against the slot's own noise floor, then trimmed by `FT8_SNR_CAL_OFFSET_DB` (`ft8_test.c`, currently 15.0 dB). **That offset IS externally validated** — the operator ran a thorough side-by-side against WSJT-X on the same signals when it was set, so reported levels track WSJT-X and are safe to publish (PSK Reporter spotting relies on this). An earlier version of this note said the value had "no external ground truth" / was awaiting a WSJT-X comparison; that was stale and led to a wrong caveat being raised in 2026-07-26. Re-verify only if the SNR pipeline itself changes.

**CQ-row filtering**: `ft8_qso_cq_filter_active()` is true throughout a CQ-originated session; `rebuild_list()` in `ft8_screen_view.c` then hides other stations' `CQ ` rows so replies to us stand out.

**Decode-list aging (v0.15.1)**: the list is a live picture of who's on frequency *now*, not a history log. `ft8_screen_get_all()` in `ft8_screen.c` expires entries not re-decoded within `FT8_ROW_STALE_SEC` (60 s) during the snapshot. The 1 Hz clock timer (`t_clock_cb`) sets `s_refresh_pending = true` every tick so stale rows drop even when the band is quiet and nothing new is decoded. "Heard: N" → "Active: N".

**No slot-skip**: `ft8_task` captures *every* non-TX slot, including the parity opposite an armed TX. With ping-pong decode a capture is exactly one slot (15 s) and ends on the next boundary, so the armed burst still fires on time — and capturing the opposite slot is the only way to hear the station we're working. (The old v0.13.1 parity-skip was removed in v0.15.0: it made us deaf on the partner's slots. The "~19 s swallow" it guarded against was pre-ping-pong, when capture+decode were synchronous.)

**UI**: TX confirmation modal has "Auto Pounce" button (visible for REPLY kind only) alongside "Transmit". The left-pane status label (`s_lbl_tx`) is always visible and shows — in priority order: ACTIVE (red), ARMED (amber), QSO complete (green), QSO timeout (orange, tap to clear), `ft8_status` passthrough (dim white).

**`ft8_status.c`**: tiny mutex-protected string written by ft8_task (RX capturing, decoding, TX symbol count), read by the 1 Hz LVGL timer. Shows what the FT8 process is doing at all times.

**`ft8_tx` extensions**: added `FT8_TX_KIND_ROGER_RPT` / `FT8_TX_KIND_73` and `extra_field[8]` to `ft8_tx_request_t`. `ft8_tx_build_request` now takes a `const char *extra` parameter (NULL = use `my_grid`, for backward compat).

## Branch state

| Branch | What | State |
|--------|------|-------|
| `main` | **v1.15.0 (2026-09-18) - THE FIRST FLASHER-ONLY RELEASE, AND THE BAND-PLAN KNOB FINALLY MEANS SOMETHING.** Two app slots instead of three: 47 KB free in a 4 MB slot becomes 2.87 MB, and the price is one USB-C flash for every existing user. ⛔ **NO `qmx_panadapter.bin` IS ATTACHED TO THIS RELEASE, DELIBERATELY** - the device builds its OTA URL from the tag, so a missing asset is a clean 404 on EVERY firmware version, guarded or not. **Measured, not assumed**: v1.14.3 flashed onto the bench and pointed at a nonexistent tag gave `esp_https_ota: File not found(404)` -> `update failed: could not reach the download`, zero bytes written, no reboot, the ota task exiting through its own `out:` path. v1.14.4's size guard only protects v1.14.4 users; the missing asset protects everyone. ⚠ The cost is the MESSAGE - a v1.14.4 user would have got "needs a USB-C cable, once" from the size guard and instead gets "could not reach the download", so the announcement is doing real work. ⭐ **THE BAND-PLAN KNOB IS THE WINDOW, AND IT TOOK THREE DESIGNS.** (1) Re-frame on the new dial - still bounced, because the web path never declared the re-frame and the still display held the view. (2) Pan freely, retune only when forced - correct and UNUSABLE: the QMX puts the VFO at +12 kHz in a ±24 kHz baseband, so the reachable spectrum is `dial-36k..dial+12k` and dragging left moved 40 kHz while dragging right ran out in a few and dragged the dial along welded to the box edge (*"the dial stay as much as possible in a strange manner"*). (3) Shipped: the pan is PRESERVED EXACTLY and the dial moves with the drag - box, marker and passband translate as one rigid object. ⛔ **AND IT WEDGED THE DEVICE FROM THE WEB.** Applied on the httpd task (priority 5, 10 KB stack) it stopped `fft_task` dead: ring permanently full (`DROPPED=48000/s`), core 1 at **0.0% idle for 400 s**, httpd unresponsive, LVGL still drawing at 13 fps - **no crash, no reboot, nothing in the log**. The discriminating test was a drag on the TOUCHSCREEN, which does identical work on taskLVGL and does not wedge. It queues now (`ui_request_bandplan_view()`, 20 ms LVGL timer). ⭐ **THE SETTINGS BACKUP WAS MISSING 31 SETTINGS INCLUDING THE POWER CALIBRATION**, found by auditing `qmx_settings_t` against `config_io.c` field by field after Bruce N9JCV lost his across an update. His own case is still UNEXPLAINED - the shape-discard cannot be it, because Calibrate Power and the `PWRCAL_STEPS` 23->45 change both landed INSIDE v1.14.0 and `pwr_cal_band_t` is byte-identical v1.14.0..v1.14.4. ⚠ `tx_tone_hz`/`tx_tone_hold` were worse than missing - ACCEPTED on import, never written on export, so save-and-restore silently reverted both. **A diff of the two key sets is the cheapest test there is and had never been run.** The calibration is written as a LIST of `v:w` pairs, not a fixed-width row, precisely because PWRCAL_STEPS has already changed once - so the export is also the migration path the NVS blob cannot have. Round-tripped on hardware: the operator's real 45-point 20 m row exported, cleared and re-imported byte-identical. Band names are `strncasecmp` now (a hand-typed `20m` silently made a duplicate row the firmware never looked at) and an empty value clears a band. `CFG_BUF_BYTES` 16384->32768, and truncation now logs an error instead of producing a backup that just stops mid-section. ⭐ **WSPR REFUSES TO BEACON IN SPLIT** (John W5JSS): in split the radio keys VFO B while `FA;` still reports A, so every wsprnet spot names a frequency the signal was never on - unattended, for hours. It refuses and says why rather than clearing the split, because `cw_split_maintain()`'s own rule (*"an operator running their own split has not asked us to interfere"*) does not stop applying when the mode changes, and the QMX cannot be brought out of split over CAT anyway. ⚠ -1 ("not answered yet") deliberately does NOT refuse. Sensing verified on the radio; **the refusal branch is NOT exercised** - reaching it keys the radio if the guard is wrong. **WSPR TX block: red on orange measured 1.15:1** and the blue state 1.50:1 - the text colour comes from the PLATE now, not the warning, and "FULL PWR" carries the alarm in words. The `TX ON next m:ss` branch set no plate at all, so it kept the ON-AIR orange while merely counting down. **The on-screen keyboard needed `LV_EVENT_CLICKED`** - `FOCUSED` only fires on GAINING focus, so tapping an already-selected field did nothing (Samuel W7STF, 9 fields across 7 modals). **The SD indicator** is crossed out in grey with no card and opens a benefits page on a tap; the bottom bar used to open the updater wherever you touched it. **The WSPR schedule is two counts**, not a ratio. **The band-plan grab strip is 8 mm (92 px)** - 50 px was 4.3 mm, below every touch-target guideline, and a miss on a DRAG target starts a tune instead of just failing. PRIOR: **v1.14.4 (2026-09-18) - THE MULTI-TASK CRASHES WERE ONE MEMORY EXHAUSTION, AND THE SOAK PROVED IT.** 15 consecutive boots before the fix reached a **median of 0.25 h** (longest 0.58 h); after moving 17,172 B of rarely-read `.bss` to PSRAM the same bench ran **14.72 h** with 0 crash records, 0 reboots, 0 allocation failures and the DMA pool flat (hourly means 12.3 -> 11.3 KB, min 9,859 B, against 1,715 B before). `s_table` 11,264 B (ft8_screen.c), `s_cfg_fallback` 3,596 B (main.c), `s_batch` 2,304 B (pskreporter.c). ⛔ **AND IT RESURRECTED A FEATURE A MEMORY GUARD HAD BEEN SUPPRESSING.** `update_check.c`'s quiet auto-download is gated on `AUTODL_MIN_INTERNAL_FREE` (32 KB); internal free had sat at 22-24 KB for months, so it logged "held" every 30 min and NEVER RAN - the operator said the checkbox was obsolete and I contradicted him three times from the call path before measuring the values. The reclamation put internal free at 33-36 KB, i.e. across that threshold, so a dormant feature was about to re-arm itself in the release immediately before the one that MUST NOT be fetched over the air. **Generalise: after reclaiming RAM, go looking for every guard with a free-heap threshold and ask what it has been holding back.** Auto-download and its checkbox are now removed outright - one route only: tap the notice, Download now, Restart now - and `ota_update.c` refuses an image larger than `esp_ota_get_next_update_partition()->size` before writing a byte, using the Content-Length `esp_https_ota_begin()` has already read. That is what makes the NEXT release (the 2.81 MB repartition, flasher-only) announce itself instead of failing. ⭐ **THE DXCC TABLE NAMED THE WRONG PLACE FOR 79 PREFIXES**, found by parsing cty.dat and diffing all 6,310 of its prefixes through both tables rather than reading rows: Taiwan as China (BM-BQ fell through the bare `B`), Ukraine/Uzbekistan as Russia (`U5`/`UM` under bare `U`), nine US Pacific entities as Hawaii (AH/KH/NH/WH unqualified), USVI as Puerto Rico, sixteen UK secondaries as England, `ZK` as Cook Is. 496 wrong-place prefixes -> 417, and every one of the 417 is now a territory OF the country named. `util/country.c` is the single answer for all ten call sites, with `geo_coords` (Uwe's ~4,100 prefixes) as the fallback for the ~130 entities dxcc.c never knew. **Countries spelled out where they fit, else the 3-letter code - NEVER truncated** (wspr_screen_view.c had TWO contradictory comments about this and the code followed the wrong one). BRG dropped from both lists to pay for the width; a gridless station gets a country-centroid distance marked `~`, because an unmarked estimate is a measurement we did not make. ⛔ **THE SELFSPOTTER HEADER WAS FOUR ELEMENTS ON THREE ANCHORS** - zoom on CENTRE, Flush/Exit on RIGHT, the ID line on LEFT - so Uwe's new Flush button simply drew over Gyula's callsign/time line. Now one budget with equal gaps, widths MEASURED from a screenshot. **WSPR bursts per transmission** (John W5JSS): "1 in N" counts the RECEIVE cycles after the group, so 1-in-3 + 2 bursts is Tx Tx Rx Rx - I first read N as the whole period, which needed a clamp, the clamp was off by one, and 1-in-2 + 2 transmitted CONTINUOUSLY on the bench. Roll from the LAST burst, which is what the code did before I touched it. Calibrate Power stops at the operator's own Max PA voltage (shown before Start, because a WSPR session legitimately leaves it at 2.3 V) and on a measured plateau. Antenna Tune gained a live SWR/W/seconds panel on BOTH screens.** PRIOR: **v1.14.3 (2026-09-17) - a v1.14.2 crash, same bug class as v1.14.0's, reached from a different task.** Randy N4OPI, reproduced 100% on two benches: picking a new TX tone from the web UI and hitting Apply while a QSO or CQ run was ARMED (not actively transmitting, not held on a busy station) rebooted the Tab5. `ft8_tx_arm()`'s Digi-mode pre-flight declared a whole `qmx_settings_t` on its own stack (`settings_load_all(&arm_sim_s)`) just to read one bool (`sim_mode_en`) - fine on taskLVGL or the CAT poll task, which is where it normally runs, but the web tone-apply path reaches it SYNCHRONOUSLY from the httpd worker task (10 KB stack): `tone_post_handler()` -> `ft8_qso_set_tx_tone_hz()` -> (ARMED, not ACTIVE, so the re-arm branch) -> `ft8_tx_disarm()` + `arm_current_if_idle()` -> `rearm_current()` -> `ft8_tx_arm()`. `rearm_current()`'s own CQ branch had the IDENTICAL pattern reading `cq_max_calls`/`cq_listen_every`. Neither showed up on the LVGL-driven web Call CQ path (that one is deliberately deferred to the 1 Hz LVGL timer, per the existing "the QSO machine belongs to that task" rule) - only the tone-apply endpoint calls straight into the QSO machine from the httpd task. Both replaced with narrow single-field getters (`settings_get_sim_mode_en()`, `settings_get_cq_max_calls()`, `settings_get_cq_listen_every()`), same pattern as `settings_get_spotmap_en()` etc. **Reproduced and verified on the dev bench via FT8 simulation mode** (no real station or radio needed): armed a CQ, hit the web tone-apply endpoint five times running, no reboot, each tone change took effect. Randy's second report in the same message - "TX Hold checkbox does not work" - is very likely collateral damage from the SAME crash: tone and hold travel in one POST body, and the device rebooted while processing the tone half, before the hold flag was ever read. Confirmed applying and reading back correctly post-fix. **Generalise (again): any function that might run on a small-stack task must never be assumed to run only on the big ones it was written for - check every caller, not just the usual one.** ⭐ **SECOND FIX IN THE SAME RELEASE: Output power was never re-asserted at BOOT, so a Tab5 restarted into FT8 transmitted at whatever WSPR last declared.** Max. PA voltage lives in the RADIO and survives a Tab5 reboot untouched - a reflash does not reset it - and WSPR's declared power legitimately drives it right down (measured: **2.3 V = 200 mW for 23 dBm on 20 m**). The ONLY place that ever handed it back was `ui_set_base_mode()`'s `cur == UI_MODE_WSPR` stand-down branch, i.e. a LIVE mode change away from the WSPR page. **Boot has no such transition** - `ui_apply_saved_mode_view()/_start()` restore the mode directly - so WSPR -> reflash -> FT8 came up at 200 mW with the drawer showing 3.6 W. Operator: *"I moved to ft8 and the output is now 200 mW and not 3.6 W as the drawer indicate"*; confirmed by asking the radio (`RX<- MM2.30;`) and by that whole boot's log having **no `PA voltage ->` line at all**. ⛔ **The obvious fix - calling `output_power_area_refresh()` from `ui_apply_saved_mode_start()` - was WRITTEN AND THEN REVERTED UNBUILT**, because that runs from `app_main` at a few seconds of uptime and **CAT does not open until ~17 s**: it would find no frequency, no band, and skip the write on every boot, silently. That is this file's own CW-pitch trap (*"that write went nowhere on EVERY boot - measured, with timestamps"*) and it would have shipped as a fix that does nothing. Keyed to the CAT link going READY instead (in `topbar_reconcile_cb`'s 1 Hz tick, change-detected, re-armed on every drop so a QMX power-cycled mid-session is covered too) - one write per link-up, not a poll, because MM writes want spacing. **Hardware-verified**: same radio, left at 2.30 V, boot into FT8 now logs `PA voltage -> 12.0 V (ok)` at 16.5 s and reads back `MM12.0;`. ⭐ **Generalise: this is the v1.12.1 top-bar bug for the third time - a state that must hold for a whole mode belongs in something RE-DERIVED, and the path with no transition (boot) is the one that gets missed. Count the entry paths before writing the first one.** | stable on ST7123 and ST7121 |

## Next up (v1.0.0 SHIPPED 2026-07-16)

**v1.0.0 released — all gates were met** (a complete standalone FT8 station with TX, logging, and ADIF upload to QRZ/eQSL/LoTW). Next major item: web-audio Phase 1 (parked on `feat/web-audio-phase1`, needs quality tuning + overnight soak). Historical gate notes below:

1. **ADIF upload to LoTW (TQSL)** — **DONE, live-verified 2026-07-14** (see "LoTW upload" section below). Real TQSL .p12 imported via the web UI's guided setup, 22 QSOs signed on-device and accepted by lotw.arrl.org. This was the last remaining gate — v1.0.0 is releasable at the operator's discretion.
**FT8 TX soak — DONE (operator's call, 2026-07-10).** Multi-session on-air TX proved stable and non-hanging, so TX is considered soaked in and is no longer a release gate. The former "beta caveats" (no duty-cycle protection, no audio loopback verification, no over-temperature monitoring) are inherent QMX-side operating characteristics, not firmware stability blockers, and per the operator's decision the user-facing TX warnings were removed in v0.20.0. All RX/panadapter/web/logging features are stable too — LoTW upload (above) is the sole remaining v1.0.0 gate.

**POTA.app has no upload API at all** — confirmed against their own docs (`docs.pota.app/docs/activator_reference/submitting_logs.html`): submission is *only* via the authenticated "My Log Uploads" browser page or emailing the ADIF file to `help@parksontheair.com`. There's no key/credential scheme a device could call, so this isn't something firmware can integrate against — don't re-investigate this without a sign that POTA has added one. The practical workaround is already in place: download the ADIF via the web UI (`/api/adif`) and upload/email it manually. (An earlier version of this note repeated the "LoTW needs its own harder design" claim — that design is now done and implemented; see the LoTW upload section below.)

### LoTW upload (DONE — live-verified 2026-07-14, last v1.0 gate)

`main/adif/lotw_tq8.c` (portable TQ8 generator, no ESP deps) + `main/adif/lotw_upload.c` (ESP glue). **LoTW is NOT an API-key service — the payload authenticates itself**: each QSO in the gzipped TQ8 file carries an RSA PKCS#1-v1.5/SHA-1 signature over a canonical string (station sigspec fields CQZ+GRIDSQUARE+ITUZ, then per-QSO BAND, CALL, [FREQ], MODE, QSO_DATE `YYYY-MM-DD` (dashes, not ADIF format!), QSO_TIME `HH:MM:SSZ` — trimmed, concatenated, **uppercased**), made with the user's LoTW callsign-certificate key. Upload = RFC1867 multipart POST of the .tq8 to `https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw/upload`, field `upfile`, **no login**; response HTML carries `<!-- .UPL. accepted|rejected -->` + `<!-- .UPLMESSAGE. ... -->`. Every format detail was reverse-verified from **tqsllib source** (location.cpp / openssl_cert.cpp / tqslconvert.cpp), not the ARRL help pages — the help-page prose is wrong in places (claims a timestamp inside the signature; there is none) and omits load-bearing details (the signature's base64 is OpenSSL-BIO 64-char-wrapped WITH a trailing newline, all newlines counted in the ADIF field length — which is also why there's deliberately no `\n` between the SIGN_LOTW_V2.0 and SIGNDATA fields).

- **Host harness first**: `test/lotw_harness.c` (gcc build line in its header; needs openssl in PATH) verifies SIGNDATA construction against hand-derived strings and round-trips signatures via openssl using a throwaway self-signed cert it generates itself. Run it after any change to `lotw_tq8.c`.
- **Cert/key onboarding**: the user's TQSL **.p12** is parsed **in the browser** by embedded node-forge (`/forge.min.js`, gzipped EMBED_FILES blob, provenance in `main/net/www/FORGE-README.txt`) — mbedtls has no RC2, and older TQSL exports use the legacy RC2-40/3DES PKCS#12 ciphers (newer ones AES/PBES2); forge handles all variants and the p12 passphrase never reaches the device. The extracted base64-DER cert (X.509) + key (PKCS#8) are POSTed to `/api/lotw_cert` together with the DXCC entity number + optional CQ/ITU zones, stored as single-line b64 in `/spiffs/lotw_cert.b64`/`lotw_key.b64` (fsync'd) and NVS `lotw_dxcc/cqz/ituz`. All included in the config export/import (full-backup decision, 2026-07-14).
- **gzip is stored-block** (uncompressed deflate blocks + ROM `esp_rom_crc32_le`, `gzip_store()` in lotw_upload.c) — deliberately NOT the ROM miniz compressor (unknown ROM compile flags/state size on the P4); TQ8s are a few KB so compression buys nothing. `gzip -t` verified on hardware output; `esp_rom_crc32_le(0, ...)` confirmed zlib-compatible.
- **Signing**: `mbedtls_pk_sign(MBEDTLS_MD_SHA1)`; key parsed per batch, zeroed after use. Cursor `lotw_uploaded_n` (same append-only-log offset pattern as QRZ/eQSL); records with no LoTW band (e.g. 11m — LoTW has no CB band) are skipped permanently with the cursor advancing, any other rejection stops the batch without advancing (retry resumes there).
- **Station subdivision (`US_STATE`/`US_COUNTY`), added v1.3.3.** We emitted **none** before, so US operators' uploads carried no state/county and earned no WAS or county credit — for them or the stations they worked. Found by cross-checking against CardSat (Paul N8HM). Two traps, both avoided: the tSTATION field names are TrustedQSL's **internal** `US_STATE`/`US_COUNTY`, **not** ADIF `STATE`/`CNTY` (ADIF names → "ADIF field data length overflow" → the whole tSTATION is rejected → **every tCONTACT is orphaned**); and `US_COUNTY` is the **county name alone** (`Arlington`), never `VA,Arlington`, which is rejected as "Invalid value in field" (stripped in both the browser form and `lotw_upload.c`). The sigspec field list is **alphabetical**, so these append **after ITUZ** — which is why adding them leaves every existing non-US signature byte-identical. `test/lotw_harness.c` gained CardSat's worked-example station part (`5FM18LU8ARLINGTONVA`) as an **external** vector: that string came from a QSO LoTW actually accepted, so it checks our field order against something other than our own reasoning. **Unverified:** whether LoTW *rejects* a US tSTATION lacking state vs just crediting nothing — needs a US cert, so it's implemented as optional and never required.
- **Success detection is a SUBSTRING test**, matching TQSL's own check (`strstr(result, "accepted")`, v1.3.3 — was `strcmp`, stricter than the reference and so able to report failure on a decorated-but-successful status). Still matched only against the extracted `<!-- .UPL. -->` comment, never the raw page, so a login/landing page can't false-positive.
- **The upload cursor only rewinds when the cert actually CHANGED** (v1.3.3). It used to rewind on every import — and since the station-location fields live only in the setup page, which requires re-picking the `.p12`, adding a state/county re-submitted the same cert and would have re-signed and re-sent the entire log for a two-field edit.
- **`GET /api/lotw_tq8`** returns the whole log signed as a downloadable .tq8 — the offline verification path (gunzip + openssl-verify on a PC) and usable for manual upload at the LoTW website.
- **LIVE-VERIFIED end-to-end 2026-07-14** (operator OZ1LAV): real TQSL .p12 imported through forge in a real browser, 22 QSOs signed on-device and **accepted by lotw.arrl.org**. Also earlier verified with a throwaway self-signed cert (host harness + on-device openssl signature checks). FT4 note: LoTW mode `FT4` is valid directly (confirmed in current TQSL config data). ⚠ **Our ADIF stopped saying `MODE=FT4` in v1.9.6** — see the ADIF MODE/SUBMODE quirk below; the TQ8 still carries `FT4` because `lotw_mode_from_adif()` collapses `MFSK`+`SUBMODE` back before signing, and that identity is the whole design.
- **Web-UI setup is a guided 2-page flow** (`#lotw-modal` in index.html): page 1 explains the TQSL "Save the Callsign Certificate" export (most users did it once, years ago) with **Next** opening ARRL's own `lotw-help/save-certificate` page in a new tab + advancing to page 2 (the import form). Button reads "LoTW setup" until configured, then "LoTW ↑"; **Ctrl-click re-runs setup** (cert renews ~every 3 years). Importing a cert **rewinds the upload cursor to 0** (`settings_set_lotw_uploaded_n(0)` in the `/api/lotw_cert` handler) — a new key means the whole log must be re-signed; server-side dupes are harmless.
- **CRITICAL — LoTW setup must pause the spectrum WebSocket** (`pauseWs()`/`resumeWs()` in index.html, wired into the modal open/close + upload). This board's esp_hosted WiFi link is low-throughput; the ~10 fps spectrum WS saturates the uplink, and the 73 KB forge.min.js fetch landing on top of it **stalled and hard-wedged the single-threaded httpd** (ping still replied, httpd never recovered — reboot only). Diagnosed 2026-07-14 when the operator's first real import wedged the web server repeatedly (`curl` always worked because it held no competing WS stream). Same principle as the upload path quieting itself. Do NOT remove the WS pause, and do NOT reintroduce any large browser-side fetch that runs concurrently with the WS stream on this link.

### QRZ Logbook upload (shipped v0.16.2)

`main/adif/qrz_upload.c` — POSTs each ADIF record not yet uploaded to `https://logbook.qrz.com/api` (`KEY=...&ACTION=INSERT&ADIF=...`, one record per request — QRZ has no batch-insert action). Progress is tracked as a plain count (`settings_set_qrz_uploaded_n()`/`qrz_uploaded_n` in NVS) rather than per-record state, since `adif_log.c` only ever appends — anything before that offset was uploaded by an earlier run. `adif_log_get_record(idx, ...)` (new in `adif_log.c`) reads one ADIF line by index for this purpose.

Entry point is the web UI only (no touchscreen UI — a ~36-char API key is painful to type on glass): a "QRZ ↑" link next to the ADIF download link in the bottom bar. First tap prompts for the API key (`prompt()`), POSTs it to `/api/qrz_key` (saved server-side via `settings_set_qrz_api_key()`, not just remembered in the browser), then every tap POSTs to `/api/qrz_upload` which runs the batch and returns `{uploaded, failed, error}`. `/api/status` gained `qrz_key_set` so the web UI knows whether to prompt again.

On the first QRZ rejection (bad key, quota, etc.) the batch stops rather than skipping past it — the same cause usually applies to every subsequent record, and stopping means a retry after fixing the cause resumes exactly where it left off (the upload offset isn't advanced past the failure).

Needed `esp_http_client` + `mbedtls` (cert bundle, already enabled via `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE`) added to `main/CMakeLists.txt`; `max_uri_handlers` bumped 10→12 in `webserver.c` for the two new endpoints.

**Important fix bundled with this**: HTTPS uploads were failing outright with `ESP_ERR_HTTP_CONNECT` until `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_MEM_ALLOC_MODE` was switched from `MBEDTLS_INTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC` to `MBEDTLS_EXTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC` in `sdkconfig`. The TLS handshake buffers (16 KB+) were competing for the ~200 KB internal DRAM already under pressure from USB host/audio/FFT/LVGL — this was the firmware's first-ever outbound HTTPS connection (SNTP is UDP only), so the path had never been exercised before QRZ upload. Moving mbedtls's allocations to the 28 MB of free PSRAM fixed it. If any *future* outbound HTTPS integration (LoTW, etc.) mysteriously fails to connect, this is already fixed — look elsewhere first.

### eQSL upload (shipped v0.16.2)

`main/adif/eqsl_upload.c` — POSTs to `https://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/ImportADIF.cfm` (spec verified directly against `eqsl.cc/qslcard/ImportADIF.txt`, revised 2026-03-01). Unlike QRZ, eQSL's real-time interface accepts a **whole batch** of QSOs in one ADIF blob (header + multiple `<EOR>` records), so uploads go in batches of `EQSL_BATCH_MAX` (20) records per request instead of one-at-a-time. eQSL has no API-key scheme — auth is the user's eQSL username + password as plain form fields (`EQSL_USER`/`EQSL_PSWD`), sent over HTTPS per their own admonition. Batch/encode buffers are allocated from PSRAM (`MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM`) rather than stack, since an encoded ADIF blob can run into the tens of KB.

Response is an HTML page parsed for `"Result: x out of y records added"` (success) or an `"Error:"` string (stop the run, same "don't skip past it" logic as QRZ). Progress tracked the same way as QRZ: `eqsl_uploaded_n` in NVS, advanced only past batches eQSL actually accepted.

Entry point: "eQSL ↑" link in the web UI bottom bar, next to "QRZ ↑". First tap prompts for username then password (two separate `prompt()` calls, since eQSL needs both), POSTs to `/api/eqsl_creds` (JSON body, saved server-side). `/api/status` gained `eqsl_creds_set`.

## FT8 robot (auto-answer CQ) — LIVE, un-shelved 2026-06-26

`main/ft8_robot.c`/`.h`. Was shipped SHELVED in v0.18.4 (the `feat/panadapter-bandnav-ft8-robot` branch's Step 6 — see `docs/version-history.md`) pending an on-air soak test that never got scheduled; the operator made the call to ship it un-soaked rather than wait further, accepting that hams are responsible for their own station regardless. `ft8_robot_tick()`'s hard `return` guard is removed; the implementation underneath was never touched while shelved.

**What it does**: when `robot_en` is on and the QSO machine is IDLE, scans the live decode list each slot for CQ callers, applies the same include/exclude filters as CQ-run — **including worked-before, which is NOT enforced: it follows the operator's `excl_worked_before` checkbox like every other filter** (`ft8_robot.c`, the `f->excl_worked_before &&` gate; an earlier version of this note claimed the robot enforced it regardless, which is wrong and produced a field report — BD4AHS, 2026-08-06, robot re-calling already-worked stations, resolved by ticking the box) — ranks survivors by the chosen priority (Strongest SNR / Weakest SNR / Most distant grid), and hands the winner to the existing `ft8_qso_start()` machine — from there it's indistinguishable from a human-initiated pounce (TX1→report→RR73→73→ADIF log).

**Disclaimer, by design not just documentation**: this keys the radio and runs full QSOs with zero per-exchange confirmation. The "Auto-answer CQ (robot)" row in the FT8 Filter modal carries a permanent on-screen warning (`LV_SYMBOL_WARNING " Transmits unattended - never leave running unsupervised"`) every time that row is visible, not a one-time dialog. The operator remains responsible for everything transmitted under their callsign while it's enabled — same as any other unattended FT8 software (WSJT-X's own robot mode, etc.).

## ARRL Field Day mode (v0.18.8)

`field_day_en`/`fd_class`/`fd_section` in settings; UI lives in the FT8 Filter modal alongside the existing reply filters.

**Wire format**: `ftx_message_encode_arrl_fd`/`decode_arrl_fd` in `components/ft8_lib/ft8/message.c` (the message type was enumerated in `message.h` but never implemented — confirmed also missing upstream in `kgoba/ft8_lib`). Bit layout `call1(28) call2(28) ir(1) class-number(4) class-letter(3) section(7)` + the standard 3-bit `n3`/`i3` — verified byte-for-byte against WSJT-X's own `packjt77.f90` (`pack77_03` subroutine) fetched directly via `curl`, not trusted from an LLM-summarized fetch (the first summarized fetch was independently re-verified line-by-line afterward and matched exactly). The 86-entry ARRL/RAC section table lives in both `message.c` (`s_arrl_fd_sections`) and is duplicated in the Python/host self-test scripts used during development — if the table ever needs to change, update both. Generic MSB-first `bits_pack`/`bits_unpack` helpers added rather than hand-rolled shifts, cross-checked against the existing `ftx_message_get_i3`/`get_n3` bit extraction to confirm the same bit-numbering convention. `n3=3` vs `n3=4` splits the 1–32 transmitter-count range in half (1–16 vs 17–32) to fit a 4-bit field — this is WSJT-X's own encoding trick, not a bug.

**QSO machine** (`ft8_qso.c`): the initial TX1/CQ grid-exchange message is **unchanged** — FT8's CQ message format has no room for class+section, so Field Day mode never touches it. Only the report-equivalent step changes: pounce's partner sends class+section with no `R` (their first FD-specific message), we echo back `R <class> <section>`; CQ-run mirrors this. `split_msg3()` replaced the old fixed-3-token `sscanf` parse (which silently truncated anything past the first word of the third field) since the FD exchange field can contain embedded spaces. `is_roger_token()` recognizes `"R "` (space, not a sign/digit) as an FD-style ack — purely content-based, no mode flag needed, since that combination never occurs in a plain grid/report token. This QSO-machine choreography (which message carries class+section, when the `R` prefix appears) is a **reasoned design, not a verbatim copy of WSJT-X's own FD-mode sequencing** — that exact spec could not be found/verified in the time available; the wire-format bits are independently verified, the sequencing is not. If a real on-air FD contact behaves unexpectedly, look here first.

**Call CQ auto-tag**: `ft8_cq_modal.c`'s `ft8_cq_get_active_text()` forces `CQ FD <call> <grid>` (replacing, not stacking with, any other modifier like `DX`/`POTA` the active preset carries — FT8's CQ format has room for exactly one modifier token) whenever `field_day_en` is on. The logic is centralized in `apply_fd_tag()`, shared between the real TX path and the editor's live preview line, so the preview can never drift from what actually transmits. While the mode is on, the 3 CQ presets + their radios + Save + the quick-insert button are all dimmed **and** `LV_STATE_DISABLED` **and** early-return-guarded in their own handlers (belt-and-suspenders — don't rely on LVGL's DISABLED state alone blocking input for every widget type); Cancel is the only thing left active. This was an explicit, iterated UX request: a static warning text wasn't enough, the operator wanted the irrelevant controls visibly/functionally locked out.

**ADIF**: `CONTEST_ID=ARRL-FD`, `STX_STRING`/`SRX_STRING` (literal `<class> <section>` text — the field most loggers actually parse for FD), `ARRL_SECT`/`MY_ARRL_SECT`. No dedicated "CLASS" field exists in the ADIF spec — it's folded into STX/SRX_STRING.

**Self-tests** (all PASS on hardware, run at boot): `ft8_arrl_fd_selftest()` — pure bit-level encode/decode round-trip, 7 cases. `ft8_arrl_fd_e2e_selftest()` — the strongest verification available without a second real station: encodes a message, synthesizes its actual GFSK audio waveform (`synth_gfsk_heap()`, a **heap-allocated** port of `ft8_lib`'s `gen_ft8.c` demo synthesizer — the original uses ~620 KB of stack VLAs, which is fine on a PC but an instant stack-overflow panic on an ESP32 task), and feeds it through the real `monitor_process`/`ftx_find_candidates`/`ftx_decode_candidate` pipeline. **Must run on a task with ≥64 KB stack** (same as `ft8_task`) — running it inline on `app_main`'s "main" task (8 KB, `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE`) caused an immediate `Guru Meditation: Stack protection fault`; both self-tests now spawn their own task. `ft8_synth_and_decode()` (exported from `ft8_test.c`) is the general-purpose version of this pipeline, reused by FT8 simulation mode below.

## FT8 simulation mode (v0.18.8)

`main/ft8_sim.c`/`.h`. A `"FT8 Simulation Mode"` checkbox in the FT8 settings drawer only (`DRAWER_SEC_SIMMODE` in `ui.c`, same FT8-exclusive pattern as `DRAWER_SEC_DISTANCE`) — practice a full QSO with zero real stations and **without ever keying a real, possibly-connected QMX**.

**Phantom stations**: two fixed identities in `ft8_sim.c` (`W1AW`/FN31, `K9ZZ`/EN52/class `5B`/`WCF`) periodically "call CQ" by running real text through `ft8_synth_and_decode()` (the same encode→GFSK-synthesis→real-decoder pipeline the Field Day e2e self-test validated) and injecting the result via `ft8_screen_record_decode()` — so what appears in the decode list genuinely round-tripped the real receive pipeline, not hand-built text.

**Reply scheduling**: the module polls `ft8_tx_get_status()` for the IDLE/ARMED→ACTIVE rising edge, then reads `ft8_qso_get_state()` **immediately after** — by that point `ft8_qso.c`'s `set_current()` has already moved the state machine to whatever it's now waiting for, so the *target* state (not the one we came from) directly says what the phantom should reply with: `WAIT_RPT`→grid or FD class+section (no R), `WAIT_ROGER`→numeric roger or `R`+class+section, `WAIT_RR73`→`RR73`, anything else→no reply. This module **never reaches into `ft8_qso.c`'s internals** — it only ever feeds `ft8_screen_record_decode()` the same input a real signal would, so the QSO machine cannot distinguish a simulated contact from a real one. Confirmed live: a full simulated Field Day QSO with K9ZZ logged to ADIF with every FD field populated correctly.

**Hard TX interlock lives in `ft8_tx.c`, not in `ft8_sim.c`.** `ft8_tx_run()` and `ft8_tx_arm()` both read `sim_mode_en` directly from settings (not cached, re-checked every call) and skip every `cat_*` call — `TX;`/`TA<freq>;`/`RX;`/`PC;`/`SW;`, the Digi-mode pre-flight's `cat_set_mode()`, the `cat_poll_set_paused()` pause/resume — substituting a `[SIM]`-tagged log line instead, while still running the identical real-time symbol-timing loop (so `ft8_qso_on_tx_complete()`'s slot-cadence timing is unaffected). This is unconditional regardless of target callsign: if a real QMX is connected while sim mode is on, it never receives a byte, full stop. Don't move this check into `ft8_sim.c` — the interlock needs to hold even if `ft8_sim.c` is never touched again.

**Breathing red bezel** (`ui.c`, `s_sim_border`): a 10 px red border around the whole screen, pulsing via the same `lv_anim` breathing technique as the diag-log dot and edge-swipe grips. Re-foregrounded every second by a dedicated `lv_timer` (`sim_border_keepalive_cb`) because later-created modals (Filter/CQ/Identity/...) are also children of the same LVGL screen and would otherwise end up drawn on top of it, hiding the border behind whatever's open. Added after the first version shipped with **zero visual feedback** on toggling the checkbox — looked exactly like "nothing happens" even though the backend (confirmed via serial log) was working correctly; this is now the primary way the operator confirms sim mode actually took effect.

Simulated QSOs log to the same ADIF file as real ones — no special-casing in `ft8_qso.c`'s `WAIT_DONE` completion path, which was a deliberate design choice (lets you test the logging/upload path too) but means clearing the log afterward if you don't want practice contacts mixed with real ones.

## CW Audio (shelved — v0.18.5, extended v0.18.6)

`main/audio/cw_audio.c` — CW demodulation + I2S playback to the Tab5 speaker/headphone jack. Fully implemented and works end-to-end, but **disabled by default; disabled since v0.18.5 due to a regression v0.18.6 partially, not fully, closed**.

**v0.18.5 band-aid (incomplete)**: e07f114 (v0.18.1) introduced CW audio infrastructure. The v0.18.5 fix commented out `cw_audio_preopen()` (I2S/ES8388 init in `main.c`) and `dsp_cw_forward()` (hot-path call in `audio.c`'s producer) — the two things CW audio actually *does*. This was believed to restore FT8 decode yield to v0.18.0 levels (avg 39–45/slot) from the regressed 11–15/slot.

**v0.18.6 — found more, but the gap is still open**: it didn't fully restore yield. On 2026-06-25 the user reported that *no release after v0.18.0* sustained decode as well as v0.18.0 itself, even with the v0.18.5 band-aid applied — confirmed by re-testing multiple releases back to back. Three things were found and fixed, but a same-night A/B still showed a real gap to v0.18.0 afterward:

1. **`cw_audio_init()` in `main.c` was never disabled** alongside `cw_audio_preopen()`. It unconditionally spawns `cw_audio_task` at **priority 6 on core 1** — higher than `fft_task` (4, the audio ring's sole consumer for *both* the panadapter spectrum and FT8 capture) and both FT8 tasks (1) — looping forever on a 120 ms `vTaskDelay`. Since `cw_audio_preopen()` was already disabled, `s_codec_ready` can never become true, so the task does nothing useful — it just wakes, checks three booleans, and sleeps. But that's still ~125 preemptions of `fft_task` per 15 s FT8 slot, for the entire session, on every release since v0.18.1. Now also commented out in `main.c`.
2. **3/4 of a separately-validated fix (`d140485`) was missing** — the v0.18.1 emergency revert threw it out along with the actual e07f114 regression it happened to be caught up with; only the FT8 double-spawn guard was ever cherry-picked back (`6f878f6`). Restored: `cat.c` poll-task tolerance for transient CDC failures, poll-task-routed DiGi-forcing, freshest-commanded-freq snapshots, memory-recall optimistic display. See the `v0.18.6` entry in `docs/version-history.md`'s "Appendix - archived engineering notes from CLAUDE.md" for the full list.
3. **`ui_push_spectrum()`** (10 Hz, core 0, same priority as `audio_task`) did an unconditional `lv_obj_set_style_opa()` call every tick — now skips it unless the value changed.

This fits the "Rosetta stone" clue from the earlier v0.18.4 sparse-decode investigation (see memory `project_ft8_sparse_decode_investigation`): the *first* FT8 slot after a fresh USB re-enumeration (ring empty, no backlog) decoded great; every slot after collapsed. A priority-6 task preempting the ring's sole consumer every 120 ms lets ring backlog grow over a session, so later captures read time-shifted audio that still finds sync (sync detection tolerates jitter) but fails to decode (LDPC needs exact symbol alignment) — explaining the cliff after slot 1.

**Measured same-night same-band A/B (fading conditions, so numbers are conservative)**: v0.18.0 ~23 decodes/slot (5-slot sample); HEAD with fix 1 only ~12/slot (8-slot sample); HEAD with all three fixes ~15.2/slot (31-slot sample) — fix 3 alone bought a real ~25% improvement, but **the gap to v0.18.0 is not fully closed**. Whether the remainder is residual code regression or band-fading confound (each test ran in a different few-minute window as the band faded through the night) is **unresolved** — next investigation session should do a same-time-of-day comparison against v0.18.0 to settle it cleanly.

**Long-term fix pending** (before re-enabling CW audio at all):
- Root-cause analysis of the original I2S/DMA/UAC contention that motivated the v0.18.5 band-aid in the first place
- Fix `cw_audio_task`'s priority/cadence so it can't preempt `fft_task` even when idle (e.g. lower priority than 4, or event-driven wake instead of a 120 ms poll)
- Pipeline redesign: either full-rate UAC + async resampling at lower priority, or spawn the CW demodulator on a dedicated core to avoid starving the audio producer
- Re-enable and soak CW audio with measured FT8 yield verification on peak-band conditions, sustained over a full session (not just the first slot)

Do not attempt to re-enable without addressing both the original contention AND this task-priority issue — naive re-enabling will regress FT8 decode performance again, the same way it did for four releases.
