# QMX+ Panadapter

*By Steffen Lav (OZ1LAV).*

A standalone real-time panadapter — spectrum analyser and waterfall — for the [QRP Labs QMX/QMX+](https://www.qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html) HF transceiver, running on the [M5Stack Tab5](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/tab5) (ESP32-P4 with a 5" 720×1280 touch display).

The QMX exposes I/Q audio over USB UAC plus CAT control over USB CDC-ACM. The Tab5 connects to the QMX as a USB host, decodes the I/Q in real time on the ESP32-P4, and renders a touch-driven panadapter with tap-to-tune, pinch-zoom, onboard FT8/FT4 decoding and transmit, ADIF logging, and a matching browser web UI.

**Documentation:** [tab5.lav.dk](https://tab5.lav.dk) — the user guide, quick-start, and reference as plain web pages. A more approachable read than this page if you just want to set the device up; the source code and release downloads stay here on GitHub.

> **v1.15.0 reclaims 2.81 MB of flash that no partition has ever used, and that

> limit is what stops a failed download taking the layout with it.
>
> So this one arrives as a **flasher download**, using the same USB-C data cable

> time. It is the only release that needs it, and everything after it is over the
> air again — with more than twice the room.
>
> **There is no over-the-air image attached to this release, on purpose.** If you
> tap the update notice it will say the download could not be reached. That is
> the release refusing to be installed the wrong way, not a fault.
>
> **Your settings, memory channels, QSO log and LoTW certificate are kept.** Press
> **Enter** at the flash-type prompt. Do *not* press **E** — that erases the whole
> chip, including your log and your LoTW private key, and it is not needed here.
>
> **Brand-new users are unaffected** — a first install already uses the flasher,
> so it lands on the new layout directly.

> **Release — v1.15.1.** A complete, self-contained FT8/FT4 station: spectrum and waterfall, on-device decode and transmit, automatic QSOs, ADIF logging, and upload to **four logbooks — QRZ, eQSL, ARRL LoTW and your own Cloudlog or Wavelog** — with no PC in the loop. It runs offline for POTA/SOTA, streams to any browser on the LAN, and carries its own user manual inside the firmware.
>
> **v1.15.0 makes the band-plan slider a window you drag rather than a dial you scrub** — grab the framed block and the picture, the frequency marker and the filter passband all travel together and stay where you let go, with the radio following. The **Config download was missing 31 settings, including the measured power calibration** — an hour at a dummy load per band, and the one thing in the file nobody could recreate from memory (found from a question by Bruce N9JCV). **WSPR now refuses to beacon while the radio is in split**, where every spot would name a frequency your signal was never on (John W5JSS), and the WSPR transmit block is legible again after being red-on-orange at a contrast ratio of 1.15 to 1 (John W5JSS). The **on-screen keyboard comes back on a second tap** (Samuel W7STF), a **missing SD card says so and explains what a card is for**, and the **WSPR transmit schedule is two plain counts** instead of a ratio nobody could agree on.
>
> **v1.14.2 fixed general sluggishness some users saw starting with v1.13.0** (thanks to Randy N4OPI for tracking it down with me) — SelfSpotter's background PSK Reporter connection could hold up the display, whether or not the map was ever opened. Also fixed a web UI "find open slot" tool that could hang and lose contact with the radio mid-QSO, output power reading near-zero right after Calibrate Power (thanks Gyula HA3HZ), and a SelfSpotter map bug that drew some countries as boxes.
>
> **New in v1.14.0 — Calibrate Power.** Sweeps the QMX's *Max. PA voltage* through 45 points on a dummy load and measures the real RF output at each with the radio's own `PC;` readback, per band. **WSPR's Declared power** dropdown now only offers the standard dBm steps your calibration actually reaches — each one classified from the real measured wattage (the same rounding rule the WSPR wire format itself is limited to), not the textbook figure a step's name implies, so what you declare and what actually goes out can no longer disagree. The old fixed "turn the PA down to 6 V for the whole beacon" guard is gone — protecting the finals is now a matter of picking a low declared level, same as any other choice on that dropdown, and a plain warning appears above 1 W. A separate **Output power** slider does the equivalent job for every other mode (FT8, CW, SSB, ...) and stays off the WSPR page entirely, since Declared power always owns the radio there. Both grow a **Recalibrate this band** button once calibrated.

> **SelfSpotter's callsign-to-country table rebuilt from an authoritative source** *(Uwe DL8UG)* — roughly 580 hand-curated prefixes replaced by ~4,100 generated from a cty.dat-style file, plus a new **ISO** column on the map's LIST tab naming each spotting station's country.

## Features

Everything below is in the firmware **today**. Nothing here needs a PC, and only the
items marked *(needs WiFi)* need a network.

**Real-time panadapter** — Spectrum and waterfall across a 48 kHz window centred on the
QMX VFO, at 30 Hz, with 12 kHz IF-offset compensation. Tap or drag to tune (mode-aware
snapping), pinch to zoom ×1–×24 with a true zoom-FFT, one-finger drag to pan and retune.
Adaptive per-bin noise floor, flat-spectrum mode, adjustable waterfall black level and
contrast, selectable FFT window, and a graphical S-meter calibrated in dBm. A colour
band-plan strip tracks the VFO (IARU region 1/2/3, auto-selected from your grid) and can
be dragged to scrub across the band.

**A spectrum that holds still** — From ×2 zoom up, the spectrum and waterfall stay where
they are and the VFO marker moves across them, so a signal stays put on screen while you
tune towards it and the waterfall's history stays lined up under the frequency it belongs
to. It really does hold still: the picture never slides along with the dial. Tune far
enough and your filter passband reaches the screen edge, keeps going, and once about half
of it has slid off the display pages in one step, carrying part of the old screen across.
The trigger is your filter passband rather than a percentage of the view, so it behaves
the same in every mode. Tapping a spot moves only the marker when the spot is already on
screen, and re-frames when it is not. On by default, and switchable. At ×1
the view stays centred on the dial, because the view is already the whole 48 kHz the radio
sends. The band above dial+12 kHz is hatched on both screens — the radio genuinely cannot
hear it, and drawing something there would be inventing signal.

**RIT** — Pull in a caller answering off your frequency without moving transmit: arm it,
tap the caller, and a marker shows where you are listening while the gold line goes on
meaning the dial. A long press parks the offset and restores it.

**QMX CAT control** — Live frequency, mode (USB/LSB/CW/DiGi, plus AM on QMX firmware
1.04+), SSB filter bandwidth, CW passband, passband overlay, TX power and SWR readout,
QMX volume in decibels matching the radio's own display, and an Antenna Tune button on
1.04+. Round-trip CAT latency under 50 ms. Band presets with per-band frequency recall,
and 32 memory channels in a 4×8 grid holding any frequency and mode.

**FT8 and FT4, receive** — Continuous on-device decoding in the same view as the
panadapter: FT8 (15 s slots) and FT4 (7.5 s slots). The decode list shows callsign,
country, signal report, slot-timing offset (DT), audio tone (HZ), distance and bearing,
with the station you are working held at the top. Include/exclude filters match anything
in the message text, worked-before stations can be excluded band-by-band, and a pileup
tracker collects everyone calling you.

**FT8 and FT4, transmit** — Tap a station and the correct *next* message is sent
(WSJT-X double-click style); or call CQ from one of three editable presets, with an
optional stop-after-N-calls limit. Full automatic exchange through to `73` and an ADIF
entry, a resend if your partner never heard your final, a polite hold for a station
already working someone else, grey-listing for stations that never answer, and an
optional unattended auto-answer robot. Your TX tone is a permanent on-screen button with
a live occupancy strip, drag-to-pick tone selection, **TX Hold**, and a cycling
**TXCQ ANY / EVEN / ODD** time-window choice. ARRL Field Day exchange mode included.

**QSO logging and upload** — Every contact is written to an ADIF log on the device, with
timestamp, callsign, grid, frequency, band, mode, both signal reports and distance
(never a report that was not actually exchanged). Read the log on the Tab5 or in the
browser, delete single records or all of them, and upload *(needs WiFi)* to **QRZ
Logbook**, **eQSL**, **ARRL LoTW** and **your own Cloudlog or Wavelog** — LoTW QSOs are
signed on the device itself with your own callsign certificate. A signal report or a
park/summit reference can be corrected after the fact from the browser's log table. The
browser's **ADIF restore** merges a previously downloaded (or any logger's) ADIF file
back in — contacts already logged are skipped — so an erase-and-reinstall does not cost
you your worked-station history. Or **restore straight from the microSD card**, on the
Tab5 itself with no computer at all. **Search the log** on either screen — by callsign,
country, band, mode, date or park — and in the browser **tick rows and export just
those** as their own ADIF file.

**Live spots on the spectrum** *(needs WiFi)* — **POTA** park activations, and optionally
**RBN** CW skimmer spots and **DX cluster** spots, drawn onto the trace at the frequency
the station is actually using. The cluster is where phone activity comes from — skimmers
are machines, and no machine recognises a callsign spoken into a microphone. One station
is one entry, however many sources report it. Grey means you have already worked them on
that band. Press and drag to pick one, lift to tune it *with the right mode*. Spots fade
with age and are gone after 30 minutes; corner counts take you to the ones just off-screen.

**Knowing you are getting out** *(needs WiFi)* — **Who is hearing me** asks PSK Reporter
which receivers have copied *your* call, with distance, bearing and the report they gave
you. **SWR protection** cuts a transmission short and latches the transmitter off above
your chosen limit, because an FT8 burst is thirteen seconds of key-down into whatever the
antenna is doing.

**WSPR** — A third page, reached by the same swipe: **Panadapter → FT8/FT4 → WSPR**. WSPR
is a propagation beacon rather than a contact mode — a very slow, very weak signal
carrying only your callsign, grid and power, which stations worldwide report hearing, so
over an evening you get a picture of where your antenna and your band actually reach at
levels where nothing else would be heard at all. Nobody replies and nothing goes in your
log. The page lists what was heard each two-minute cycle with the band, distance and
bearing, and the furthest of the session. Receiving is the default; transmitting is opt-in, refuses to
key without your callsign and grid, and has a transmit schedule and optional band hopping.
**Calibrate Power** sweeps *Max. PA voltage* on a dummy load and measures real RF output
at each step, per band. **Declared power** then only offers the standard WSPR dBm steps
your calibration actually reaches — each one labelled with its real measured wattage, not
a textbook figure — so what you declare (published worldwide with every spot) matches
what actually goes out. A WSPR transmission keys the radio for about 110 seconds in every
120, so picking a low declared level for long beacon runs is how you protect the finals
now, rather than a fixed voltage cut applied underneath you. **Output power**, a separate
slider for every other mode (FT8, CW, SSB, ...), shares the same calibration but stays out
of WSPR's way entirely — Declared power always owns the radio there. What you hear can be
published to wsprnet.org *(needs WiFi)*.

**Radio menus** — The QMX's own 80×24 menu system, on the Tab5 and in the browser, over
the radio's *second* USB serial port so the panadapter keeps decoding while you are in
there. For a QMX+ with no control panel it is the only way in. Leaving hands the radio
back properly and restores your frequency and mode.

**Updating from the device** *(needs WiFi)* — A new release is fetched quietly in the
background and offered once, in a window in the middle of the screen, with **Restart now**
or **Later**. Nothing is ever installed without you asking, and the automatic download can
be switched off if you are on a metered connection. The spectrum, waterfall and FT8
decoding keep running throughout.

**Activation logging** — Start a **POTA** or **SOTA** activation and every contact is
stamped with the reference as it is logged, counted against the threshold, with chases
tagged from spots already seen and a single-reference ADIF export for uploading.

**Bluetooth mouse** — A pointer that works *while the QMX stays plugged in*, which a USB
mouse cannot do on this hardware. Pair once; it reconnects by itself. Move, click, and a
wheel that scrolls whatever is under the pointer — **and over the spectrum or waterfall,
that wheel tunes**: 10 Hz a click in CW and the digital modes, so a signal can be
zero-beaten by ear, and 100 Hz in SSB *(Roy KI0ER, John Dusek)*. It stops at the band
edges, and anything on top of the panadapter — a modal, the settings drawer — takes the
wheel instead, so the dial never moves under something you are reading.
**The mouse must be Bluetooth 4.0 or
later (Bluetooth Low Energy).** The Tab5's Bluetooth comes from a co-processor with no
Bluetooth Classic radio, so an older Classic mouse cannot work and no firmware change can
help — it never appears to the Tab5 at all. Most mice sold since about 2014 qualify; a
dual-mode mouse works on its Low Energy channel.

**PSK Reporter spotting** *(needs WiFi)* — The stations you decode are reported to
[PSK Reporter](https://pskreporter.info) the way WSJT-X does, so you appear on the map as
a monitoring station. **On by default**; sends your call and grid plus each decoded
station's call, grid, frequency, report and mode, batched at most once every five
minutes — over the internet only, **never on the air**. One checkbox turns it off, and it
is inert until your callsign and grid are set, and in simulation mode.

**Web UI** *(needs WiFi)* — The whole panadapter in any browser on the LAN: live
spectrum and waterfall at ~10 fps, click or drag to tune, mouse-wheel pan and tune,
band/mode/bandwidth/zoom control, a graphical S-meter and the whole-band plan strip. In
FT8/FT4 mode it shows a live TX status banner and a **Call CQ** button instead of the
stream. Also: the QSO log as a sortable table, config download/upload as an editable text
file, a microSD file browser, screenshots, and the diagnostic log.

**Built-in user manual** — This entire guide is compiled into the firmware, so it opens
instantly with no WiFi, no card and no download, and can never describe a different
version than the one you are running. It opens at the chapter for the screen you are on,
warning banners are tappable, and a **Need guidance?** panel lets you pick your symptom
in plain words. See [Getting help](#getting-help).

**Time, with or without a network** — SNTP when WiFi is up *(needs WiFi)*, the Tab5's own
supercap-backed RTC across power-off, the QMX's clock as an offline fallback, GPS
detected and phase-locked automatically if your QMX has one, and a manual set-and-sync
panel. FT8/FT4 timing also self-corrects from the decoded band consensus when offline.

**Decoded CW** *(new in v1.11.1)* — In CW or CW-R, a line along the bottom of the
panadapter shows the Morse the radio is decoding, with an estimate of the sending
speed. The **QMX does the decoding itself** and hands the text over CAT, so it costs
the panadapter no processing at all and does not touch the spectrum or FT8. Works on
QMX firmware 1.03 and later, on the Tab5 and in the browser, and switches off in the
settings drawer under Radio *(suggested by Uwe DL8UG)*. With a card in the slot it is
also written to `qmx-panadapter/cw-decode.txt` with timestamps, so a half-caught
callsign can be resolved afterwards *(Michael K Johnson KZ4LY)*.

**Frequency format** — The frequency readout, preset buttons, WSPR band picker, keypad
and spectrum scale can be punctuated `14.074.000` (the default, and what the QMX shows
on its own LCD) or `14,074,000` *(Don N2VGU)*. Settings drawer, under Advanced.

**microSD station backup** — Insert a card (a plain FAT32 32 GB card is ideal) and your
whole station is mirrored to `/qmx-panadapter/`: the ADIF log, a
full config export, your LoTW certificate and key, the diagnostic log and a
self-describing `README.txt`. Continuous with WiFi off (green **SD** dot); one complete
backup per start-up with WiFi on (yellow dot), because the card and the WiFi
co-processor share a bus. It restores too, which is the half that was missing: **Restore
from SD** in the Tab5's own log window, or from the browser. And because the card mirrors
the *present*, the copy from just before the log last got **smaller** is kept beside it as
`qso.prev.adi` — so a deletion you notice two restarts later is still recoverable.
**After inserting the SD card your Tab5 needs a restart** — the card is claimed during a
short window early in boot, so one pushed in while it is running is not used until then.
*(The card holds credentials — WiFi password, QRZ/eQSL logins, LoTW private key — so keep
it physically secure.)*

**Diagnostics** — An always-on diagnostic log, nothing to enable: 5 MB in RAM, a rolling
copy in flash that survives a power cut, and a full mirror to microSD if a card is in.
Downloadable from the browser or over USB serial. **A crash survives the reboot** — if the
Tab5 ever restarts unexpectedly, the next boot records what happened, in which part of the
firmware and how far into the session, so a diagnostic download is enough to answer it.

**Practice mode** — A simulator with phantom stations that call CQ and reply through the
real encode/decode pipeline, so you can rehearse a full QSO with **no radio connected**
— and with a hard interlock that never keys a QMX even if one is attached.

**Touch, keyboard, mouse** — Edge-swipe navigation with breathing grip handles, an
on-screen keyboard, and optional support for the M5Stack Tab5 70-key snap-on keyboard —
which drives the radio's own menus, works in every window with buttons, scrolls the
settings drawer and the manual, and carries Ctrl shortcuts you can reassign yourself. It
can be attached or reattached at any time, not only at boot. A **Bluetooth keyboard** does
the same: every text box, Enter and Esc in every window, Tab between fields and the arrow
keys, with the on-screen keyboard stepping aside while one is connected. A keyboard and a
mouse can be connected at once, in either order. ⚠ Bluetooth keyboards are **US layout
only** — a Bluetooth keyboard reports key *positions* rather than characters, so letters,
digits, Enter and the arrows are right on any keyboard while punctuation on a non-US
layout will not be. Plus USB mouse support. *(The mouse and the QMX cannot share the single USB host port — the
ESP32-P4's USB stack lacks the Transaction Translator a hub would need — so the mouse is
for setup, log review and reading the manual with the radio unplugged.)*

**Settings you decide the shape of** — Every setting appears on the Tab5 and in the
browser, and the drawer has a **Basic** and an **Advanced** view. Which sections appear in
which is yours to set, from a **Tab5 config** button in the web UI's Settings window; a
firmware update that adds a setting shows it rather than hiding it behind a layout saved
before it existed.

**Built for the field** — WiFi is entirely optional, and can be given a static address if
you want the browser bookmark to keep working; battery percentage with a charge limit for
battery care; display sleep and a 180° flip for awkward mounting; config backup and
restore as a text file; and a settings reset that does not need a reflash.

## Quick Guide

### Step 0 — Check your QMX firmware first

Power the QMX on by itself and read the firmware version off its own display at boot. You need **1.03.002 or newer**. If yours is older, update the QMX *before* connecting the Tab5 — everything that follows depends on it. This takes 10 seconds to verify and saves hours of debugging. Both **1.03.002** and the **1.04 betas** work with the panadapter (1.04.004 is what this is developed against day to day); on 1.04 the Tab5 additionally offers **AM mode** and an **Antenna Tune** button (SWR tune with a live power/SWR readout) — both stay hidden on 1.03.002, so there's no downside either way.

### Step 1 — Flash the Tab5 firmware

Use the one-click flasher in [`tools/QMX-Panadapter flasher/`](tools/QMX-Panadapter%20flasher) (also attached to each [release](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/releases)):

1. Plug the Tab5 into your computer with a **USB-C data cable** — charge-only cables will not work.
2. Run the flasher:
   - **Windows** — double-click `flash.bat` (fetches esptool by itself on first run; nothing to install)
   - **macOS** — double-click `flash.command` (needs esptool once — `brew install esptool` recommended; `pip3 install esptool` often fails on recent macOS with an "externally-managed-environment" error). If macOS blocks the script, right-click → **Open**, or run `bash flash.command` in Terminal (no `chmod` needed).
   - **Linux** — `bash flash.command` (needs `pip3 install esptool`)
3. The flasher asks **normal or clean** (see below) — just press **Enter** for a normal flash.
4. Wait for `SUCCESS`. The Tab5 restarts on the new firmware.

**The firmware is already in the zip** — `bootloader.bin`, `partition-table.bin` and `qmx_panadapter.bin` sit next to the script, and those are what get flashed. Nothing is downloaded except `esptool` itself, once, if your computer doesn't already have it. So after the first successful run the flasher works with no internet at all.

**Normal vs clean flash.** Just before flashing, the flasher asks:

> *Type E for a CLEAN/ERASE flash, or just Enter for a normal flash*

- **Normal (press Enter)** — updates the firmware and **keeps** all your saved settings (WiFi, callsign, grid, memory channels, ADIF log). This is what you want almost every time.
- **Clean (type E)** — wipes the whole chip first, so **every saved setting is permanently erased**: WiFi name *and* password, callsign/grid, all memory channels, and the logged QSOs. Use it only if something is stuck or corrupted (e.g. WiFi refuses to turn on no matter what). Back up first with **Config ↓** (below) so you can restore in seconds afterwards.

**If the flash keeps failing, reboot the Tab5 and try again — before anything else.** The Tab5's USB serial connection is produced by the ESP32-P4 itself rather than by a separate USB chip, so a busy running firmware can leave the COM port listed in Windows Device Manager while it no longer answers the flasher. A reboot clears it. After that, the usual causes are a charge-only cable or a serial monitor still holding the port. *(Samuel W7STF, after a 7-hour session.)*

Building from source? See [Build from source](#build-from-source).

### Step 2 — Connect the cables

You need **two** USB connections, and the cable to the QMX is the one people get wrong:

| Connection | Port on Tab5 | Cable | Carries |
|------------|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Tab5 → QMX** | **USB-A** (host) | **USB-A → USB-C, full data cable** | I/Q audio (UAC) + CAT (CDC-ACM) |
| **Tab5 → power** | **USB-C** | Any USB-C power cable (5 V / 2 A+) | Power |

> **The #1 failure is a charge-only cable.** Many USB-C cables — especially thin ones bundled with phones and chargers — carry power only, no data lines. If you use one between the Tab5's USB-A port and the QMX, the Tab5 powers the QMX but sees no audio and no CAT: the spectrum stays flat and the top bar shows `Band: ---`. Use a cable you know does data (one that works for a USB stick or phone file transfer). When in doubt, swap the cable first.

**Power-on order matters.** Turn the **Tab5 on first** and let it finish loading, then turn the **QMX on**. Within a few seconds the top bar should populate Band / Mode / BW and the spectrum should come alive.

Once flashed you can power the Tab5 from any 5 V/2 A USB-C source or the internal battery — the laptop is only needed for flashing. For diagnostics the Tab5 also outputs a serial log over the USB-C data connection (useful if WiFi is not available), but for most users the built-in **diagnostic log** — always on, nothing to enable — is the easier path — see [Step 7](#step-7--something-not-working).

### Step 3 — Find your way around

The whole app is driven by **one-finger swipes from the screen edges** and **taps on the top bar**. The settings drawer is always one swipe away — no hunting for hidden menus.

| Gesture | From | Does |
|---------|------|------|
| Swipe → | Left edge | Cycle Panadapter → FT8/FT4 → WSPR |
| Swipe ← | Right edge | Open settings drawer |
| Swipe ↑ | Bottom edge | Open memory channel picker |
| Tap or swipe ↓ | Any top-bar item | Open that item's selector |

Slim "breathing" grip handles on each edge show where to swipe — faint enough not to clutter the display, visible if you look for them.

The top bar reads **Band · Mode · BW · Freq · Signal · Zoom** left to right. Tap any item to open a selector — **Freq** opens the frequency keypad; **Mode** switches USB/LSB/CW/DiGi; **BW** selects SSB filter width (USB/LSB only); **Band** jumps to a configured band; **Zoom** selects a zoom preset.

See the [full gesture table](#gestures) in the Reference section.

### Step 3b — Choose FT8 or FT4 mode

FT8 is available on all HF bands; FT4 is available on select bands with published frequencies (20 m, 30 m, 40 m, etc.). To switch between them:

1. **In Panadapter mode:** Tap the **Mode** selector in the top bar, then choose **DiGi** (the digital mode group).
2. **In FT8 screen:** Tap the **Preset** frequency button to open the band/mode picker — you'll see **two columns**: FT8 (gold header) on the left, FT4 (cyan header) on the right. Tap any frequency in the FT4 column to switch modes.

The decode list, TX controls, and slot timing (countdown bar, which-parity-next) all adapt automatically to the active mode. Switching modes clears stale decodes from the previous mode so you don't work old QSOs.

**When to use each mode:**
- **FT8** — Most populated band in SOTA/POTA; longer decode window gives more time to prepare replies on slow links or weak signals.
- **FT4** — Faster QSO cycle for busy bands (Field Day, major contests, 20 m pile-ups) and operators who prefer shorter waits between exchanges.

### Step 4 — Fill in your settings

**On first boot the Tab5 opens a setup prompt automatically** — it will ask for your callsign, grid square, and WiFi credentials before you reach the main screen. You can skip any field and fill it in later via the settings drawer.

To open the settings drawer at any time: swipe in from the right edge, or tap the right grip handle.

- **WiFi** — enter your SSID and password. Recommended for everyone: you get accurate UTC time (needed for FT8 slot timing), the browser web UI, and remote diagnostics. The **WiFi initiated** checkbox below the WiFi section is an on/off master switch — uncheck it for POTA or field use with no network.
- **Identity** (callsign + grid square) — *only required for FT8/FT4 transmit*. Enter your callsign and Maidenhead grid (4 or 6 characters, e.g. `JO45` or `JO45ab`). The grid also drives the distance and bearing columns in the FT8 decode list.

Everything else — dB range, smoothing, colour map, brightness, IQ balance — has sane defaults. Adjust if you want to, but you don't need to on first use.

### Step 5 — Using the panadapter

Switch the QMX to any band and watch it come alive. This is the foundation of the device regardless of which modes you operate.

**Tap or drag to tune.** Touch anywhere on the spectrum or waterfall to place the cyan cursor. Drag and it snaps to a mode-aware grid — 10 Hz steps in CW, 250 Hz in SSB, 500 Hz for FT8/FT4 — so you can land precisely on a signal before lifting your finger. Lift, and the QMX retunes.

**Swipe fast to pan instead.** A quick horizontal swipe (rather than a held drag) slides the whole view left or right and retunes to wherever you let go — the fastest way to slide along a band. See [Touch-to-tune](#touch-to-tune) for exactly how the two gestures are told apart.

**Or move precisely with the band-plan slider.** For a controlled move rather than a quick swipe, drag the framed "visible window" on the band-plan strip (along the bottom) to exactly where you want to be on the band — the spectrum, waterfall, and VFO all follow it, so you can place yourself precisely on a segment before you even tap a signal.

**Zoom in on a crowded band.** Pinch with two fingers to zoom up to ×24. On a CW band at ×8 or higher you can resolve individual signals a few hundred Hz apart, read the spacing between callers, and pick your target before you tune. The frequency axis scales with you, down to Hz precision at high zoom. Double-tap anywhere to reset to the full 48 kHz view.

**Find your place on the band.** The thin band-plan strip along the bottom of the screen (just above the status bar) colour-codes the CW/Digi/Phone segments around you — pick your IARU region (or leave it on Auto) in the settings drawer → **Band-plan region**. The framed window on the strip is a **slider**: drag it (or tap anywhere on the strip) to move precisely to any spot on the band, and the spectrum, waterfall and VFO all follow along. You can also grab that slider from anywhere along the bottom status bar and drag sideways — a taller target — while a vertical up-swipe there still opens memory channels.

**Read your passband.** Two grey vertical lines on the spectrum mark your current filter edges. The BW label in the top bar shows the active width; tap it to choose 2.5 / 2.7 / 2.9 / 3.2 kHz in USB or LSB. A coloured tint fills the passband so you can always see exactly what slice of the band you're receiving.

**Watch the S-meter.** The Signal field in the top bar is a live tick-scale bar (S1 through S9+20), driven by the actual signal under your VFO cursor.

**Flat-spectrum mode.** Toggle **Flat spectrum** in the settings drawer to switch from absolute dBm to dB-above-local-noise-floor. Noise collapses to a calm baseline; real signals — including weak CW tones in the mud — pop sharply above it. Recommended on noisy bands.

**Save your spots.** Swipe up from the bottom edge to open the memory channel picker — a 4×8 grid of 32 channels. It doesn't greet you with blank cells: a fresh device arrives with a handful of **example channels already filled in**, and each one is **colour-coded by mode** (CW green, DiGi teal, USB brick-red, LSB purple) so you can read the whole grid at a glance without opening a single label. The very first time you open it, a quick **guided animation** walks you through the gestures — watch a channel slide to a new slot, then drop into the wastebin and vanish — so you learn "drag to move, drag to delete" in about ten seconds, once, and never again.

Then it's yours: **tap** a channel to recall it (the QMX retunes instantly), **tap an empty slot** to store the current frequency/mode, **long-press** to edit, **drag** a channel to reorganise the grid, and **drag onto the wastebin** (bottom-right cell) to delete it.

**Monitor from another room — or operate remotely.** Once WiFi is configured, open `http://<tab5-ip>` in any browser for a full-featured live panadapter with mouse-driven tuning, band/mode controls, and ADIF log download. The IP is shown in the bottom status bar. See [Web UI](#web-ui).

### Step 6 — FT8 (if that's your thing)

Swipe in from the **left edge** to switch to the FT8 screen. The Tab5 starts decoding 15-second slots immediately — no PC, no WSJT-X required.

1. Tap the **Preset** button and pick your band's conventional FT8 dial frequency (e.g. 14.074 MHz for 20 m).
2. Watch the decode list fill. CQ stations appear at the top sorted by SNR; exchanges and replies below.
3. To reply to a station: **hold your finger on their row** for ~250 ms. A dim highlight appears after ~80 ms so you can see which row you're targeting before the gate fires. Lift — a confirmation modal shows the exact message before anything is armed.
4. Tap **Auto Pounce** to hand the full QSO to the auto-engine (works through report → RR73 → 73 with patient retry), or **Transmit** for a single manual message.
5. To call CQ: tap **Call CQ**. The engine picks a clear audio slot, fires CQ, automatically answers the first caller, runs the full exchange, logs the QSO, and resumes calling CQ.

Every completed QSO is written to an ADIF log downloadable from the web UI. See [FT8 Transmit](#ft8-transmit) for the full picture, including ARRL Field Day exchange mode and a no-radio-keyed practice/simulation mode.

### Step 7 — Something not working?

**Spectrum flat, top bar shows `---`:**
- Check the cable between Tab5 and QMX — almost always a charge-only cable.
- Make sure the QMX is powered on and not stuck in its own bootloader.
- Power cycle in order: Tab5 first, then QMX.

**For anything else:**

1. The diagnostic log is **always on** — nothing to enable.
2. Reproduce the problem (let it run a minute; power-cycle the QMX if the issue is about connection).
3. Grab the log:
   - **Over WiFi:** in the web UI take **Files ▲ → Diagnostic download ↓**. That one item fetches **both** logs — `qmx-log.txt`, the current session held in RAM, and `qmx-log-saved.txt`, the copy persisted to flash that survives a reboot or a flat battery. If the device restarted, the saved one is the interesting file. (Directly: `/api/log` and `/api/log/saved`.)
   - **microSD:** if a card is inserted, the log is mirrored to `/qmx-panadapter/qmx-log.txt` on the card — continuously with WiFi off, or up to the start-up backup with WiFi on (alongside the always-on flash-persisted copy, which is complete either way).
   - **Over USB (no WiFi needed):** capture the serial console with `tools/capture_serial_log.ps1`.
4. Open an [issue](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/issues) and attach the log. It includes Tab5 and QMX firmware versions plus every CAT command exchanged — usually enough to pinpoint the problem immediately.

## Getting help

**This whole guide is inside the firmware.** No WiFi, no microSD card, no download: it works on the first boot, in a field with no signal, and it can never describe a different version than the one you are running. Swipe ← from the right edge to open the settings drawer; the top two buttons are the two ways in.

**User Manual — opens where you are.** Not a contents page to search: it opens the chapter covering the screen you were on — the panadapter chapter, the FT8 **receive** chapter, or the FT8 **transmit** chapter if a transmission is armed or running (someone mid-transmission is asking a different question). Inside: **Contents** is a two-column list — press and slide, and lifting your finger opens the highlighted chapter; **Back** returns to the previous page (shown only when there is one); **Exit** puts you back where you came from. Edge swipes and top-bar taps are stood down while the manual is open, so a stray touch cannot retune behind it. Holding the **User Manual** button for 3 s resets the reader; the manual itself is part of the firmware and cannot be lost.

**Need guidance? — describe the symptom, not the cause.** The second drawer button opens a short list headed *"What do you need help with?"*, written the way you would say it out loud — "My radio is not showing up", "Nothing appears in the decode list", "It never transmits", "How do I change what my CQ says?", "Where are my contacts logged?" Pick the one that fits and the manual opens at the section that answers it. The list holds questions as well as faults, and it scrolls — keep going past the first few rows.

**Rows the Tab5 can see are happening now are highlighted and floated to the top**: no CAT link to the QMX, IQ mode never confirmed, an empty decode list while FT8 is running with the radio present, or WiFi switched on but not connected. WiFi switched **off** deliberately — POTA, battery — is not reported as a fault; that row stays as a normal question. **The device ranks, you choose:** a highlighted row is a suggestion, and it will never navigate for you on inference. The rows offered are scoped to the screen you opened the panel from, so FT8 never offers you spectrum symptoms.

**Warnings you can tap.** A warning you cannot act on is half a warning. The red **"QMX IQ mode not confirmed"** banner across the top of the screen is a button — tap it for the section on that exact fault. The **"Waiting for QMX"** message carries a small **Need help?** button; it says *help* rather than *what is wrong* on purpose, since a radio that is off is often off deliberately.

If a chapter does not answer your question, that is a documentation bug worth reporting — the wording of these rows is written from what operators actually say.

## Panadapter

### Touch-to-tune

Tap anywhere on the spectrum or waterfall to place the cyan tune cursor. Drag and the cursor snaps grid-point to grid-point — you can see exactly which frequency will be tuned before you lift. The snap grid is **mode-aware**:

**Tune vs. pan — how your finger is read.** A quick horizontal swipe (more than ~70 px within 250 ms) pans the view instead of tuning — see [Zoom & Pan](https://tab5.lav.dk/guide/panadapter/#8-zoom-pan). A slower touch-and-hold (250 ms without that much movement) locks into tune mode, after which dragging moves the snap cursor as described below. In short: swipe fast to pan, hold-then-drag to tune.

| Mode | Snap step |
|------|-----------|
| CW / CW-R | 10 Hz |
| USB / LSB | 250 Hz |
| FT8 / DiGi / RTTY | 500 Hz |
| AM | 1 kHz |

The grid is anchored to absolute frequency (e.g. …200 / 300 / 400 Hz), not to your touch start point, so the cursor always lands on the same set of grid points regardless of where your finger first touches.

A floating frequency tooltip above the cursor shows the target frequency in real time while dragging. Lift → CAT `FA` command is sent and the QMX retunes. What the display does next depends on **Still spectrum**, below.

Taps always tune to exactly where you touched (snapped to the mode-aware grid above). The old **Snap to signal** option — which hunted for the strongest bin near your tap — was removed in v0.19.4; predictable tuning won.

**Passband indicator.** Two grey vertical lines mark your current filter edges. A faint coloured tint fills the passband. The amber VFO marker shows where the QMX is tuned; in CW mode it sits at dial + CW pitch offset so it marks the actual received tone frequency, not the suppressed carrier. The offset comes from the radio and is re-read every few seconds while you are in CW, so changing it on the radio is followed rather than leaving the display compensating by a stale figure.

**Still spectrum.** By default, from ×2 zoom up, the spectrum and waterfall **hold still and the VFO marker moves across them**, so a signal stays where you last saw it while you tune towards it and the waterfall's history stays lined up under the frequency it belongs to.

The display is never dragged along by the dial. It holds, completely, until it pages in one step:

| Where you are | What the display does |
|---|---|
| Your passband is inside the view | nothing moves — only the marker |
| Your passband reaches the screen edge | still nothing — it begins to slide off |
| Half a passband width past that | a page, carrying part of the old screen across |

Half a filter width is the whole allowance, and it is a deliberate compromise: long enough that a station right at the edge can still be worked, short enough that you are not tuning blind for long. How far you get between pages depends on your filter — roughly a screen-width less half a filter, so about 4.7 kHz of a 6 kHz view on a 2.7 kHz SSB filter.

**Tapping a spot** moves only the VFO marker when that spot is already comfortably on screen — the picture stays put, which is the point of the feature. If the spot is off screen, or so close to an edge that your passband would not fit, the display re-frames on it instead of leaving it stranded at the edge.

Switch it off under **Settings → Radio & display → Still spectrum**. At ×1 the view is already the whole 48 kHz the radio sends, so it stays centred on the dial.

**The hatched region.** The QMX's local oscillator sits 12 kHz below the dial, so the 48 kHz it delivers covers dial−36 kHz to dial+12 kHz — there is no data above dial+12, and that part of the display is hatched and inert. Before v1.10.5 it was filled by wrapping the bottom of the band into it and labelling it as dial+12 to +24, so tapping a signal there tuned you about 48 kHz away.

## Live spots

Other stations drawn straight onto your spectrum at the frequency they are
actually using — **POTA** park activations, **RBN** skimmer reports, and **DX
cluster** spots, which are where phone activity comes from (no machine
recognises a callsign spoken into a microphone, so SSB is invisible to RBN).

Grey means you have already worked them on that band. Press and drag to pick
one, and lift to tune it with the right mode. One station is one entry, however
many sources report it. Each source switches on separately in **Network → Live
spots**.

📖 Full chapter: [tab5.lav.dk/guide/spots](https://tab5.lav.dk/guide/spots/)

## Spot map

Live spots answer "who can I work?". The spot map answers the other question:
**who is hearing me?** A full-screen map of the stations that reported *your*
signal — the CW skimmer that copied your CQ, the FT8 station whose decode of you
reached PSK Reporter, the WSPR receiver that logged your beacon — each a line
from your grid square to theirs. Contributed by **Uwe DL8UG**.

**Tap SelfSpotter in the settings drawer** (right below "Need guidance?") to
open it, from any page. Tabs for the map, a table of the same data, and HF band
conditions. Drag to pan, pinch to zoom around your own QTH. The LIST tab's
table is sortable: **RECEIVER, GRID, COUNTRY, MODE, BAND, FREQUENCY, SNR, KM**
and **AGE**. **GRID** is the locator the receiving station itself sent, so it
is blank for CW skimmers, which report a callsign and not a location.
**COUNTRY** comes from Uwe DL8UG's 18,365-prefix table and names the *country*
a spotting station belongs to, which can differ from the DXCC entity its own
marker uses on the map (Hawaii plots at its own coordinates but reads United
States in this column).

**Always running, no setting to find.** The feeds (RBN, PSK Reporter, wsprnet)
connect from the moment the Tab5 boots and stay connected the whole session —
there used to be an opt-in switch for this, dropped once it became clear the
map was worth having populated the moment you looked. Needs your callsign and
grid square.

## Web UI

With the Tab5 on WiFi, open `http://<tab5-ip>` in any modern browser. The IP is shown in the bottom status bar on the Tab5.

The browser panadapter is a full-featured view in its own right — not just a window onto the Tab5. On a larger monitor you get more spectrum history, a bigger waterfall canvas, and mouse controls that are faster than touch for precise tuning. It shows live spectrum at ≈10 fps via WebSocket, full waterfall history (~50 s), the same thermal palette and floor maths, a graphical S-meter, and a top bar with Band / Mode / BW / Zoom controls. The bottom bar shows battery percentage, firmware version, a live UTC clock, and WiFi SSID + RSSI. To its right: download/upload buttons (ADIF, QRZ, eQSL — see [QSO logging](#qso-logging-adif)), **Files ▲ → Diagnostic download ↓** for the diagnostic logs, **Config ↓ / Config ↑** to back up / restore / edit all settings (see [Config backup, restore & edit](#config-backup-restore--edit)), and **Tab5Shot** which opens a live `/ss.bmp` screenshot in a new tab.

**microSD file browser (new in v1.3.0).** **Files → SD Files** in the bottom bar opens `http://<tab5-ip>/files` — browse the microSD card from any computer without pulling it: download your logs and config backups, upload files, delete. Card access is coordinated with the WiFi link the same way the automatic backup is, so it's safe to use mid-session.

**Remote QMX power-cycle relay (v1.10.9, sequenced in this release).** **Miscellaneous ▲ → Remote relay** pulses one of two Tab5 GPIO pins (GPIO53 or GPIO54 — the board's otherwise-unused Grove/EXT header). Drive an optoisolator from the pin and take its output to your QMX's PWR_ON/GND **signals**, and you can power-cycle the radio from anywhere on the LAN — the missing piece for a fully remote firmware upgrade, since a Tab5 flash always needs the QMX power-cycled afterward. **Pulse** fires a single pulse for the chosen duration and level — since PWR_ON is a toggle, this turns the QMX off *or* back on with no way to tell which from the LAN. **Power-cycle QMX** runs the whole sequence instead: off-pulse, wait, on-pulse, wait, then checks over CAT and tells you "QMX responded" or "no response from QMX". Scriptable as `POST /api/cmd {"action":"gpio_pulse", ...}` (single pulse) or `{"action":"gpio_power_cycle", "pin":53, "level":1, "ms":1000}` (the full sequence).

**Building the interface — Randy N4OPI's design**, published here with his permission. Two components and a connector, plus one modification inside the radio.

![Schematic: M5Stack Tab5 power switch for QRP Labs QMX(+) — a 4-pin Grove plug on the Tab5's EXT socket feeds a 100 ohm resistor into a PC817C optoisolator, whose output drives a 3.5 mm stereo jack on the module, reaching a 2.5 mm TRS jack wired to PWR_ON and GND inside the radio through a patch lead](docs/mkdocs/img/relay-schematic-n4opi.png)

The QMX has **no PWR_ON/GND jack from the factory** — fitting one is the job. Wire a **2.5 mm TRS jack** into the case with **tip to PWR_ON and sleeve to GND** (Randy brought his out on the rear panel beside the ATU RF input). Then build the interface: a **4-pin Grove plug** into the Tab5's EXT socket, the chosen pin (**G53** or **G54**) through **R1, 100 Ω ¼ W** into a **PC817C optoisolator**, and the optoisolator's phototransistor across **J1, a 3.5 mm stereo audio jack** on the module, which reaches the radio's 2.5 mm jack through a **3.5 mm to 2.5 mm TRS patch lead** — so a pulse briefly connects PWR_ON to GND. The `EXT 5V` pin is unused, and the phototransistor side is polarity-sensitive — follow the schematic. Randy: *"with just 2 components it could just as easily be connected point to point and sealed up inside a piece of heatshrink tubing. Make sure you insulate your wires so the heatshrink doesn't squeeze them together and create a short."* Settings that work: the pin you wired, active level **High**, **2000 ms**.

The optoisolator is what keeps the Tab5 and the radio electrically apart, and it is why only **G53/G54** are offered: they sit on a *keyed* connector and are held as driven outputs from boot. The bottom-edge Dupont pins would give a neater cable run, but that connector is unkeyed and sits beside 12 V IN — Randy's own reason for dropping the idea — and `G0`/`G1` are the snap-on keyboard's I2C bus.

**Whole-band plan strip & adjustable split (new in v0.20.0).** Along the bottom of the browser view (above the status bar), a colour-coded CW/Digi/Phone strip spans the entire band with a draggable "visible window" (drag or tap to retune) and a VFO marker, mirroring the Tab5's own strip. Drag the divider between the spectrum and the waterfall to give either more room — the split is remembered in the browser. **Tab5Shot** now captures any open pop-up (band/mode dropdown) too, and the frequency keypad is draggable with a standard 10-key layout.

**In FT8/FT4 mode the live stream pauses (new in v0.20.0).** The browser stops streaming the spectrum/waterfall and shows a notice plus the log and upload controls instead. While you're operating digital modes the stream would compete with the on-device decoder and the WiFi link, so pausing it keeps FT8 decoding and WiFi noticeably steadier. Switch the Tab5 back to Panadapter mode and the stream resumes automatically.

**Live TX status, and Call CQ from the browser.** In FT8/FT4 mode that same panel carries a **TX status banner** (v1.3.6) mirroring the Tab5's own label — red while transmitting including the "call 2 of 4" counter, amber armed, green on QSO complete, orange on timeout, plus the persistent "CQ stopped after N calls - no answer"; the browser tab title shows a red dot while transmitting, visible even in a background tab. Under it is a **Call CQ** button (v1.5.0, Dennis WN4FLA), so a CQ run that timed out or reached its call limit can be restarted without walking back to the radio. It **confirms first** — it keys the radio, and a mis-click from another room should not put a carrier on the air — then uses exactly what the Tab5 would: the active CQ preset, the current TX tone (honouring TX Hold) and the TXCQ ANY/EVEN/ODD parity, sharing one code path with the Tab5's own button so the two cannot drift. The request is handed to the display task, so the button greys out for a moment; watch the banner rather than the button. A request arriving while the Tab5 is not in FT8 is discarded, never queued. Replies and pounces are still initiated on the Tab5, where the decode list is.

**Click or drag to tune.** Click or drag on the spectrum or waterfall — a cyan cursor appears with a live frequency readout and commits on release.

**Mouse-wheel to pan or tune.** Rolling the mouse wheel over the spectrum or waterfall **pans** the view when zoomed in, letting you survey the band without touching the Tab5. At zoom ×1 the wheel **tunes** with mode-aware snap (CW 10 Hz, SSB 500 Hz, DiGi 100 Hz, AM 1 kHz).

**Band / Mode / BW / Zoom** dropdown pills in the top bar send commands to the QMX via `/api/cmd` — the same effect as using the Tab5 top bar.

**Zoom sync.** The browser renders the same zoomed window as the Tab5.

**QSO log — download, view, edit.** Once you have logged at least one completed FT8 QSO, a **"QSO Logs (N) ▲"** menu appears in the bottom bar of the web UI. **ADIF download ↓** fetches your `qso.adi` file directly. **View / edit log** (v1.3.5) opens the whole log as a table in the browser — click any column header to sort (click again to reverse; sorting by date groups an activation's QSOs together), delete a single record with the ✕ on its row, or **Delete all** to clear the log (it asks you to type `DELETE`, because there is no undo — download the ADIF first if you want a copy). **Search** (v1.11.0) filters as you type across callsign, band, mode, date, grid and reference, and says plainly when nothing matches — the answer to "have I worked this one". **Tick rows and press Export selected** to save just those contacts as their own ADIF file; the header tick box takes everything currently shown, so a search plus one tick gives you a single day, band or park. The menu is only shown when the log contains data.

Three columns can be corrected by clicking them: the two **reports**, and **Their ref** — the park or summit the *other* station was activating. That last one is how a Park-to-Park contact gets into the log at all: while you are operating, the other activator's park number is on the POTA spots page on your phone and not in anything the radio sends, so you note it down and enter it when you get home *(Don Adams WB0LQW)*. It also fills itself in when the contact came from a spot, and it does that whether or not you were activating — the ADIF field records *their* activity, and a hunter's log should say which park they worked. It is Park-to-Park only when you were in a park as well, which is why the column is not called that. **An empty cell is not a fault**: the reference is matched from the POTA spot feed on the exact callsign, and not every digital-mode activator registers the activation — some just start calling `CQ POTA` — so where there is no spot there is no reference, which is better than a wrong one *(Don Adams WB0LQW)*. Type the reference alone — `US-1241`, `G/LD-049`, `DLFF-0123` — and the Tab5 works out the programme (POTA, SOTA or WWFF) from its shape and writes both `SIG` and `SIG_INFO`; clear the reference and both go again. Nothing else is editable: callsign, band, mode, date and time are what QRZ, eQSL and LoTW match a contact on, so a wrong one is a delete-and-re-log.

**QRZ / eQSL upload.** Two more buttons appear alongside the ADIF link once you have logged QSOs — see [QSO logging](#qso-logging-adif) for the full picture.

### Config backup, restore & edit

The **Config ↓ / Config ↑** buttons in the bottom bar let you save every setting to a plain text file, edit it on your PC, restore it, or share parts of it.

- **Config ↓** downloads `qmx-config.txt` — a human-readable [INI-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) file with everything the Tab5 remembers, grouped into sections:
  - `[settings]` — callsign, grid, WiFi SSID/password, CW pitch, IF trim, IQ balance, flat-spectrum, zoom, colour map, brightness, dB range, EMA, GPS toggle, keypad layout, QRZ key, eQSL user/pass.
  - `[cq]` — the three FT8 CQ-message presets and which is active.
  - `[ft8_filters]` — the CQ-run include/exclude filter terms and toggles.
  - `[memories]` — the 32 memory channels, one per line: `slot = freq_hz, mode, label`.
- **Config ↑** picks an edited file and **merges** it back: only the keys and sections present in the file are changed — everything else is left as-is. Unknown keys are ignored (so a file from a newer firmware still loads). Memory channels apply immediately; other settings take effect after a restart.

Three things you can do with it:

1. **Back up before a clean flash.** Hit **Config ↓** first, do the clean/erase flash, then **Config ↑** to restore everything in seconds — instead of re-typing it all on glass.
2. **Edit in a text editor instead of on the touchscreen.** Faster for callsign, grid, CQ messages, or punching in a batch of memory channels.
3. **Share a band plan.** Copy just the `[memories]` section into a message — another operator pastes it into their file and uploads it to get the same channels (their other settings untouched).

> The downloaded file contains your **WiFi password** and **QRZ/eQSL credentials in clear text** (so it works as a full backup). Keep it private; strip those lines before sharing a file with anyone.

  "qmx_fw":      "1_03_002QMX"
}
```

Polled at 1 Hz by the landing page; safe to consume from monitoring scripts, home automation, etc. `qmx_fw` is read from the QMX via the `VN;` CAT command at link-up (empty until the radio responds). `signal_dbm` is the peak dBm around the IF-shifted VFO bin (null if DSP has no data yet). `qrz_key_set` / `eqsl_creds_set` tell the web UI whether to prompt for credentials before the next upload.

### `/ws` — binary spectrum WebSocket

Single-client endpoint. Each binary frame is 1026 bytes:

| Bytes | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0` | Frame type: `0x01` = spectrum |
| `1` | Zoom decimation factor (1 = base 1024-bin spectrum, >1 = zoom-FFT with that decimation) |
| `2–1025` | 1024 unsigned bytes, one per bin, quantised −130 dBm (0) to −30 dBm (255) |

Bins are pre-shifted server-side so byte 2 is the leftmost screen pixel. Push rate ≈10 fps.

### Who is hearing me

*(needs WiFi)* **Miscellaneous → Who is hearing me** asks PSK Reporter which receivers have copied **your** callsign recently, and lists them by distance with the country, bearing, and the signal report they gave you.

This is the reverse of the reports the panadapter *sends*, and the two are separate settings — you can have either without the other. Switch it on in the browser under **Settings → Spots & reporting**; there is deliberately no Tab5 control, because the answer is a table of distances and bearings that wants a screen you are already sitting in front of.

It answers the one question no amount of local processing can: **am I actually getting out?** The valuable case is the mismatch. Stations you can hear that cannot hear you is a transmit-side problem — antenna, power, a bad connector — and from the receiving side alone that looks exactly like a dead band.

It is read-only, and asks at most once every five minutes because that is the rate PSK Reporter requests. An empty list is the normal answer until you have transmitted: nobody can report hearing a station that has not been on the air.

## FT8 Receive

![FT8 RX in action on 20 m — decode list with DXCC, distance, bearing, and SNR](docs/QMX-Panadapter_FT8_v0.15.7.png)

*Live FT8 reception on 20 m (v0.15.7). Left pane: MODE / Preset freq / UTC / slot countdown with parity and progress bar / TX parity preference / operator identity / Call CQ / decode summary. Right pane: scrollable decode list.*

Swipe in from the **left edge** to switch to the FT8 screen. The Tab5 decodes 15-second FT8 slots directly on the ESP32-P4 — no PC, no WSJT-X.

### Prerequisites

- **WiFi configured** — recommended for accurate UTC time. Without it the Tab5 falls back to its supercap RTC or the QMX clock. See [Time sync](#time-sync).
- **Callsign and grid** set in the drawer → **Identity** if you want distance/bearing columns or plan to transmit.

### The FT8 screen

**Left pane:** MODE label · **Preset** frequency button (tap to pick a band's conventional FT8 dial frequency) · UTC clock · 15-second slot countdown with current parity (EVEN blue / ODD amber) and a gliding progress bar · **live mini occupancy strip** (the audio window as 50 Hz cells, same data and colours as the tone picker) · **TXCQ ANY / EVEN / ODD** parity-preference button (one button, cycles) · **TX nnnn Hz** tone button · **Call CQ** button · last-slot decode summary and TX status.

**Right pane — decode list:**

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| SL | Slot parity: **E** (blue, :00/:30) or **O** (amber, :15/:45) |
| CALL | Extracted callsign |
| MESSAGE | Full decoded FT8 message text |
| COUNTRY | Country, spelled out where it fits and shortened where it does not - never a 3-letter code. 227 DXCC entities, with 18,365 further prefixes resolved at country level |
| SNR | FFT-based estimate, colour-banded: green ≥0 / white −5..−1 / orange −15..−6 / grey <−15 |
| DT | Slot-timing offset in seconds, relative to the band — an on-time station reads ~0.0 |
| HZ | The station's audio tone (its offset within the FT8 passband) |
| KM | Great-circle distance from your grid. A leading `~` means the station sent no grid and the distance comes from its country — approximate, and marked as such |
| HRD | Times decoded since last appearance |

CQ calls always appear at the top sorted strongest-SNR first; all other rows follow by SNR descending.

**Row colour scheme** (CALL + MESSAGE columns): **white** for ordinary traffic, **green** for plain `CQ` calls, **dim grey** for callsigns already worked **on the current band** (a station you worked on 20 m still shows normally on 40 m — see [Reply filter](#reply-filter) for hiding them entirely), and **inverted red fill + white text** for any message containing your own callsign — your highest-priority rows literally pop off the screen instead of relying on red-on-black text, which field testing found hard to read at a glance.

**Live view.** Stations not re-decoded within 60 seconds drop off the list automatically, even while the band is quiet — the list is who's on frequency *now*, not a cumulative history. (The "Active: N" counter that used to say so was dropped in v1.3.4; the wrapping TX/QSO status text took its line.)

### Performance

On a busy 20 m FT8 slot the decoder regularly yields 25–50 callsigns per slot. Both EVEN and ODD slots decode every cycle via a ping-pong dual-buffer architecture — a TX slot never causes the opposite parity to be skipped. Heap is stable across long sessions (≈39 KB internal RAM free, 25 MB PSRAM free during decoding).

---

## FT8 Transmit

The Tab5 transmits FT8 via the QMX's `TA<freq>;` CAT command — no PC audio path, no WSJT-X. The QMX does all DDS synthesis and envelope shaping; the Tab5 sends the 79 tone-frequency commands at 160 ms cadence, bracketed by `TX;` / `TA0;` / `RX;`.

### Replying to a station

1. In the decode list, **hold your finger on a row** for ~250 ms. A dim highlight appears after ~80 ms so you can see which row you're targeting. List scroll locks once the gate fires; drag up or down to land on the right row.
3. **Lift** — a confirmation modal shows the exact message that will go on air, the audio frequency, and the target slot parity.
4. Tap **Auto Pounce** to hand the full QSO to the auto-engine, or **Transmit** for a single manual message.
5. Tap **Cancel** (in the modal, or the armed indicator in the left pane) to disarm without transmitting.

**Transmit is intelligent (v1.3.0):** it builds the correct *next* message for that station from what they last sent — the same semantics as a WSJT-X double-click. Their CQ → your grid (or your report directly, if **Skip TX1** is on); their grid → your report; their report → `R`+your report; their `R`-report → `RR73`; their `RR73`/`73` → `73`. The report value is always your live measurement of their signal. You can walk an entire QSO step by step with nothing but Transmit taps — and when you send the closing `RR73`/`73`, the QSO **logs to ADIF** exactly like an auto-engine contact. Auto Pounce is offered on any first reply; mid-QSO rows get Transmit only.

Slot parity is set automatically — if you heard them on an EVEN slot, your reply goes on ODD so they're listening when you transmit.

**The auto-engine** works the full exchange: TX1 (grid) → wait for their report → TX2 (R+report) → wait for RR73/73 → TX3 (73) → DONE. At every step it re-sends the current message for up to 4 consecutive slots if the other station doesn't respond. If no reply comes after 4 slots, the QSO times out (orange status, tap to clear).

**Skip TX1 (faster pounce).** With **Skip TX1** enabled in the Options editor, a pounce opens with your signal report immediately instead of the grid exchange — saving one round trip. If the station has already aged out of the decode list, it falls back to the normal grid TX1 automatically.

### Working a pile-up

When you call CQ or work a run, more than one station may answer at once — and a caller who replies while you're mid-QSO with someone else used to vanish from the live decode list once they stopped transmitting. They're now held in a **Pileup** list so you don't lose them:

- Whenever callers are waiting, the **ADIF-log** button on the FT8 screen becomes a **Pileup** button in a distinct colour, reverting once the list empties.
- Tap **Pileup** to see everyone who has called you and isn't worked yet. Tap a station to work them (the same confirmation modal as a decode-list tap), or tap the **✕** to dismiss one.
- **Hold the button to open the ADIF log** — the log is always reachable this way, even while the button reads "Pileup" (v1.3.0; a one-time hint appears the first time the button flips).
- A station is removed from the list automatically once you start a QSO with them, and a just-completed contact's trailing 73 can't put them back.
- Working a caller from the pileup sends the correct *next* message for that station, built from whatever they actually last transmitted — the same laddering as tapping a decode-list row (v1.3.2). Previously it always opened with a signal report, which could never produce the `R`+report a station needs when they come back minutes later with a report of their own.
- Worked-before stations appear in the pileup unless **Exclude worked-before** is checked — the pileup follows the same rule as the auto-answer, so dupes you're willing to work stay visible.

The tracker never transmits on its own — it only remembers callers; you choose who to work. If you'd rather it *did* transmit, check **Auto-work pileup** in the Options editor: when your current QSO completes (or immediately, if you check it with callers already waiting and nothing else going on), the strongest waiting caller is pounced automatically, draining the pile one contact at a time. It carries the same unattended-TX warning as the robot.

### Calling CQ — CQ-run mode

Tap **Call CQ**. No confirmation modal. The engine:
1. Scans the current decode list for occupied 50 Hz audio bins.
2. Picks the nearest unoccupied bin to 1500 Hz (standard FT8 sub-band centre).
3. Arms the CQ on the matching slot parity and waits for the boundary.

From there it's fully automatic:
- The opposite-parity slot is decoded while CQ runs so replies are never missed.
- The moment a station replies with your callsign, CQing stops and the exchange starts automatically — best-SNR caller chosen if multiple stations answer simultaneously.
- After the exchange completes (RR73 → 73 → logged), CQ resumes on the same frequency.
- A mid-exchange timeout also resumes CQ rather than dropping the frequency.
- While CQ-run is active, other stations' `CQ` rows are hidden so replies to you stand out.

Tap **Cancel** in the TX status bar at any time to stop.

### FT8 Options

Tap **Options** in the left pane to open the FT8 Options panel — everything that only means anything in FT8 mode, in one place rather than scattered through a general settings list (v1.9.4; was called **Filter**, renamed because the panel already held real behaviour toggles like Auto-work pileup and grey-listing, not just filters). Controls which stations CQ-run auto-answers, which rows appear in the decode list, and (on the web UI) the CQ message presets too.

The web UI has the same panel behind its own **Options** button, shown only in FT8 mode next to **TX tone** — CQ messages and FT8 filters were pulled out of the general Settings list into it. The button carries a count badge of how many settings are currently on rather than a plain active/inactive colour (a colour would always read "on" for anyone who runs filters permanently, which tells you nothing); hovering it lists which ones. Inside the panel, an active checkbox gets an amber border/fill in addition to its own tick mark, so "what's already set" is never a colour-only signal.

- **Include 1 / Include 2** — if either field has text, only messages containing one of its terms are eligible. Space- or comma-separated (e.g. `POTA SOTA` or `JA, VK`), matched against the *whole* decoded message text so POTA/SOTA tags, grid squares, country prefixes, `/P` suffixes etc. all work.
- **Exclude 1 / Exclude 2** — messages containing any of these terms are skipped even if they'd otherwise match.
- **Exclude plain CQ callers** — hides bare `CQ ...` rows so only replies and exchanges remain visible.
- **Exclude worked-before** — hides callsigns already worked **on the current band** (per-band, from your ADIF log) from the list and from CQ-run auto-replies; the same station on a different band is treated as not worked.
- **Skip TX1** — when you pounce a station, open with your signal report instead of the grid exchange for a quicker QSO (falls back to the grid exchange if the station has aged out of the decode list).
- **Allow grey-listing** — off by default. When enabled, a station that times out two of your pounces in a row is set aside: the robot and Auto-work-pileup skip it, its decode row turns violet, and tapping it offers to clear it rather than opening the TX dialog. Useful on a busy band where one station simply never comes back. The list lives in RAM only and is forgotten at power-off.

Tap **Save** to persist (NVS) and apply immediately.

### Auto-answer CQ (robot)

**⚠ Transmits unattended — never leave it running unsupervised.** When enabled, the robot picks a CQ caller every slot (filtered the same way as above, plus a worked-before skip) and runs the full exchange itself — no per-QSO confirmation, no tap required. Pick a **Priority**: Strongest signal, Weakest signal, or Most distant grid. Same TX1→report→RR73→73→ADIF-log flow as a manually-tapped reply; you just aren't the one tapping. You remain responsible for everything it transmits under your callsign, same as any other unattended digital-mode software.

### TX status indicator

The left pane shows a persistent status line below the slot countdown:

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Red** | `TRANSMITTING: <message>` — burst in progress, with your **audio tone on its own line**; tap to abort |
| **Amber** | `TX armed: <message>` then `nnnn Hz → EVEN/ODD, ~Ns` — waiting for slot; tap to cancel |
| **Red-orange ⚠ FREQ BUSY** | Your tone is occupied (±50 Hz guard), and the warning names the frequency so you can act on it. During CQ-run this self-heals — the next cycle hops to the nearest clear tone automatically. Mid-exchange you can now move it yourself: see **TX audio frequency** below |
| **Amber, `working <call> - waiting` + `TAP TO CANCEL`** | The station you are calling is mid-exchange with somebody else. Nothing is transmitted until they sign off or call CQ again — or tap to cancel the pounce and work someone else (v1.3.5). See **Waiting for a busy station** below |
| **Green** | QSO complete |
| **Orange** | QSO timed out — tap to clear |
| **Dim white** | FT8 engine status passthrough (capturing / decoding / symbol count / …) |

### TX audio frequency

Your transmit tone is chosen automatically — the nearest clear 50 Hz slot to 1500 Hz, scanned against the stations currently decoded. From v1.3.3 you can both **see** it and **change** it.

The **TX nnnn Hz** button in the FT8 left pane always shows it — to the right of the `TXCQ` parity button — and tapping it opens the picker. A **mini occupancy strip** under the slot countdown shows the same picture at a glance. (Before v1.3.4 this was a chip that appeared only while a CQ or QSO was running, and the tone was also repeated on the TX status line.)

| Control | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Occupancy strip** | The whole 200-2800 Hz window as 52 slots. **Green** free, **red** occupied, **white** you, **pink** your QSO partner |
| **Touch and drag** | Pick a slot by dragging along the strip. The bar goes grey and follows your finger, the readout tracks it live, and it commits when you lift off |
| **-50 / +50** | Nudge one slot at a time |
| **Find clear slot** | Scans outward from where you are and jumps to the nearest free slot |
| **Apply nnnn Hz** | Sends it to the radio |

The readout also says in words whether the slot you have picked is clear or occupied, and the free slots nearest you are listed as numbers underneath.

It applies **between** bursts. If a burst is on the air, Apply refuses and tells you to try again after it — the same rule WSJT-X operators are used to. Slot parity is untouched, so moving your tone mid-QSO does not disturb the exchange; your partner tracks the slot, not the frequency.

> **The strip shows decoded stations, not raw spectrum.** A station too weak to decode will not show as occupied, and an all-grey strip means nothing has been heard yet rather than "the band is clear".

### QSO override buttons

During an active auto-QSO exchange (any state between first reply and final 73), three buttons appear in the left pane:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Re-send / &lt;field&gt;** (amber) | Re-arms the current outgoing message immediately. The label shows what will go out — e.g. **Re-send / JO45** when waiting for their report, **Re-send / -07** when waiting for RR73 |
| **RR73** (blue) | Skips straight to RR73, bypassing the report step |
| **73** (green) | Fires the 73 sign-off and closes the QSO immediately |

These are deliberate operator nudges for busy-band edge cases where the auto-engine falls a slot behind or you can see the exchange is further along than the state machine knows. The auto-engine handles the normal case; these exist for when a quick nudge is faster than waiting through the 4-slot retry cycle.

### TX power / SWR readout

After each burst the Tab5 queries `PC;`/`SW;` for instantaneous forward power and SWR and shows the result briefly in the status line: `Last TX: X.XW SWRx.xx [Ns]`. If SWR > 4.0 (indicating the QMX SWR-protection latch tripped), the firmware automatically cycles `TX;` / 150 ms / `RX;` to clear the latch so the radio is ready for the next TX slot without operator intervention.

### CQ message presets

Long-press the **Call CQ** button to open the preset editor. Three message slots with radio buttons — check the active one. A `+ <call> <grid>` quick-insert appends your identity. Standard CQ constructions (`CQ DX OZ1LAV JO65FR`, `CQ POTA …`) and ≤13-char free text both encode via the general ft8_lib encoder. Presets persist to NVS. The Call CQ button label shows the selected message; a short tap transmits it.

**CQ auto-stop** (v1.3.5, Don WB0LQW's "I usually send CQ 2-4 times and then pause"). The editor's top-right **CQ stop** button cycles never / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 10 calls and applies the moment you tap it — no Save needed. While calling, the TX status shows the counter live ("call 2 of 4"). After the last unanswered call the Tab5 listens through one more receive slot — an answer to your final call still starts the QSO normally — then stops and goes idle. The limit applies to every CQ run, including the automatic resume after a completed or timed-out contact; each fresh sequence starts the count over. Persists across power cycles and travels in the config backup.

### QSO logging (ADIF)

Every completed FT8 QSO — pounce or CQ-run — is automatically written to an ADIF v3.1.4 file at `/spiffs/qso.adi` on the Tab5's internal flash. The log survives reboots and re-flashes.

**Download.** The web UI bottom bar shows the **QSO Logs** menu once the first QSO is logged. **ADIF download ↓** fetches `qso.adi` for import into any logging software (WSJT-X, Log4OM, DXKeeper, …) or for POTA.app, which has no upload API (see below); **View / edit log** opens it as a sortable table with per-record delete and Delete-all — see [Web UI](#web-ui).

**View and edit on the Tab5.** The **ADIF Log** button on the FT8 screen (long-press always works, even while it reads "Pileup") opens the on-device viewer: a Today/All filter with a POTA activation counter (the title turns green at 10 QSOs today), long-press a row to delete that single record, and — new in v1.3.5 — **Delete all**, next to Close: the first tap arms it and shows the live count ("ALL 34?"), a second tap within five seconds erases the log, waiting disarms it. Clearing the log (from either the Tab5 or the browser) also resets the QRZ/eQSL/LoTW upload positions, so QSOs logged afterwards upload normally. The clear-first workflow is the practical POTA tool: start the activation with an empty log and the ADIF at the end is exactly what you submit.

**Upload to QRZ Logbook / eQSL — directly from the Tab5.** Two more buttons appear next to the ADIF download link once you've logged a QSO: **"QRZ ↑"** and **"eQSL ↑"**. Tap either the first time and it prompts for credentials (QRZ: API key from *Logbook Data → API Key* on qrz.com; eQSL: your username and password — eQSL has no API-key scheme) and saves them on the Tab5, not just in the browser. Every tap after that uploads everything logged since the last successful upload — no need to re-enter credentials, and no risk of duplicate uploads, since the Tab5 tracks how far it's gotten into the log. If a record is rejected (bad credentials, quota, etc.) the run stops and reports the reason rather than skipping past it; fix the cause and tap again to resume from where it left off. eQSL accepts a whole batch of QSOs per request; QRZ's API takes one at a time, so a big log takes one HTTP round trip per QSO.

**Upload to ARRL LoTW — also directly from the Tab5.** The Tab5 signs your QSOs on-device with your own LoTW callsign certificate, so no TQSL and no PC are involved. The bottom bar shows **"LoTW setup"** until it is configured, then **"LoTW ↑"**.

Setup is a two-page guided flow. Page one points you at ARRL's own "Save the Callsign Certificate" instructions — you export a `.p12` file from TQSL, which most people did once, years ago. Page two takes that file, its password, and your DXCC entity number:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **.p12 file + password** | Parsed **in your browser**, not on the Tab5 — the password never reaches the device. Only the certificate and key are sent |
| **DXCC entity number** | Required. The same one your TQSL station location uses (Denmark = 221, USA = 291) |
| **CQ zone / ITU zone** | Optional |
| **US state / county** | **US stations only** (v1.3.3). Without them your QSOs earn no Worked All States and no county credit — for you or for the stations you work. The county is the name on its own (`Arlington`), not `VA,Arlington` |

Every tap of **LoTW ↑** afterwards signs and uploads everything logged since the last successful upload. Ctrl-click **LoTW ↑** to re-run setup — a certificate is typically valid three years. Re-importing the *same* certificate no longer re-uploads your whole log; only an actually-changed certificate resets the upload position, since a new key means everything has to be re-signed.

> Uploads are queued at ARRL's end. If a QSO does not appear immediately, check [the LoTW queue status](https://www.arrl.org/logbook-queue-status) before assuming a problem — the queue has run hours behind at busy times. LoTW rejects a malformed file at upload time, so anything that reaches the queue was signed correctly.

**POTA.app** has no upload API at all (browser login or email only), so use the ADIF download above for that.

**Fields in each record:**

| ADIF field | Content |
|------------|---------|
| CALL | Their callsign |
| FREQ | Dial frequency in MHz (3 d.p., e.g. `14.074`) |
| BAND | Amateur band (e.g. `20M`) |
| MODE | `FT8`, or `MFSK` for an FT4 contact — ADIF defines FT8 as a mode in its own right but FT4 only as a submode of MFSK, and this is the form WSJT-X writes and other software expects to read *(Don Adams WB0LQW)* |
| SUBMODE | `FT4` on an FT4 contact, absent otherwise. Never a copy of MODE: QRZ rejects that pairing outright |
| RST_SENT | Our SNR estimate (e.g. `−07`). **Omitted entirely if no report was exchanged** — writing a placeholder `599` into an FT8 log, as versions before v1.3.4 did, fabricates a measurement that then gets uploaded to QRZ/eQSL/LoTW |
| RST_RCVD | Signal report received |
| QSO_DATE | UTC date `YYYYMMDD` |
| TIME_ON | UTC time `HHMMSS` |
| STATION_CALLSIGN | Your callsign (from Identity in the drawer). This is the ADIF field POTA reads; the older `MY_CALL` spelling made POTA warn *"No station_callsign field, assuming operator …"* on every upload |
| MY_GRIDSQUARE | Your grid |
| GRIDSQUARE | Their grid (from the decoded FT8 message) |
| MY_SIG, MY_SIG_INFO | The programme and reference **you** were activating (`POTA` / `US-1241`), when an activation is set — this is what POTA and SOTA credit the activation from |
| SIG, SIG_INFO | The programme and reference **they** were activating. Filled in automatically when the QSO came from a spot, or by hand afterwards in **View / edit log** — and correct to record whether or not you were activating too; it is a Park-to-Park contact only when both of you were. Absent when the other station never registered the activation, which is why the column can be legitimately empty |
| CONTEST_ID, STX_STRING, SRX_STRING, ARRL_SECT, MY_ARRL_SECT | Field Day mode only: contest ID `ARRL-FD`, your/their literal `<class> <section>` exchange text, and their/your section alone |

**Clear.** `GET /api/adif/clear` from the web UI wipes the file and resets the worked-call cache.

> Set your callsign and grid in the settings drawer → **Identity** before your first QSO so they appear correctly in logged records.

## Time sync

The Tab5 needs accurate UTC for FT8 slot timing. Sources in priority order (highest first):

| Source | When applied |
|--------|-------------|
| **SNTP (WiFi)** | Always authoritative whenever WiFi is connected and has synced at least once — sets system clock, Tab5 RTC, and NVS |
| **Tab5 RTC** | RX8130CE supercap-backed (~30–40 h retention) — applied at boot before QMX or WiFi are available |
| **QMX `TM;`** | Offline fallback only — applied when WiFi is down or has never synced (field/POTA with no WiFi) |
| **FT8 signal timing** | Sub-second correction from the decoded signal population's average timing, auto-applied continuously every slot while FT8 is decoding (damped, so a noisy single slot can't yank the clock) — deliberately tracks who you're actually trying to work, not absolute GPS/NTP truth. A manual one-shot version is also available via the **Sync Time** modal (see below) |
| **Manual** | Full HH:MM override in the **Sync Time** modal — for rare POTA sessions with neither WiFi nor QMX clock |

Each accepted sync writes through to the RX8130CE so the clock persists across power-off. The Tab5 also polls `TM;` every 5 minutes in the background to catch QMX GPS lock events.

**For POTA / no-WiFi use:** uncheck **WiFi initiated** in the settings drawer. Time comes from the QMX on USB connect (or the supercap RTC if the Tab5 was recently synced). FT8 slot timing will be accurate from either source.

### FT8 time calibration modal

On the FT8 screen, tap **Options** → **Sync Time** to open the time calibration modal. It shows three large boxes: **\[HH\] : \[MM\] : \[SS\]**.

- **HH / MM** — pre-filled from the current UTC clock. Tap either box to edit it with a numpad. Use this for rare POTA situations where neither WiFi nor the QMX clock is available.
- **SS** — auto-syncs continuously from decoded FT8 signals. Each slot, every successfully decoded station contributes a timing sample; a robust outlier-rejecting average (median ± a tolerance window) across all of them sets the correction, so one bad decode can't throw off the reading. The box border flashes bright blue for ~30 ms each time a fresh measurement lands — a visual heartbeat that sync is active — and the hint below reads **"Flash: FT8 synced..."**. A blue frame means it is actively tracking; tap SS to lock it.
- **Apply** — if only SS was synced (HH and MM untouched), `time_sync_apply_correction_ms()` nudges the system clock by the measured sub-second offset and writes through to the RTC. If HH or MM was edited, `time_sync_set_manual()` sets the full time. The bottom bar shows **UTC(FT8)** after an FT8-derived correction, or **UTC(manual)** after a full manual set.

## Settings

The settings drawer, opened by swiping in from the right edge. It is grouped —
**Station, Device, Radio, Network, Display, FT8, WSPR, Spectrum** — with a
**BASIC / ADVANCED** button that keeps the list short until you need it to be
long. Which sections sit in which view is yours to set, from the web UI's
**Settings → Tab5 config**. Changes save themselves; there is no OK button to
hunt for.

📖 Every control, group by group:
[tab5.lav.dk/guide/settings](https://tab5.lav.dk/guide/settings/)

## WSPR

A propagation beacon rather than a contact mode: a very slow, very weak signal
carrying only your callsign, grid and declared power, reported by stations
worldwide. Swipe → from the left edge cycles **Panadapter → FT8/FT4 → WSPR**.
Receiving is the default and worth doing on its own; transmitting is opt-in.

**Calibrate Power measures what your QMX actually does, on your antenna
system, at every setting — instead of guessing from a rule of thumb.** From
the drawer (**Radio → Antenna Tune → Calibrate Power**, or "Calibrate this
band" the first time you open Declared power / Output power on an
uncalibrated band), it sweeps *Max. PA voltage* through 45 points on a
**dummy load** and records the real RF output at each with the QMX's own
`PC;` readback. Takes a few minutes per band; results are saved per band and
used from then on.

**Declared power** (the WSPR drawer) then only offers the standard dBm steps
your calibration actually reaches on the current band — no more picking
"37 dBm" and transmitting something else entirely. Each step's wattage is the
*real measured* figure, not the textbook one, so what you see is what goes
out and what gets published to wsprnet with every spot. A WSPR transmission
keys the radio for about **110 seconds out of every 120**, so this is also
where you protect the finals now: pick a low declared level for long beacon
runs, rather than relying on a fixed halving the firmware used to apply
underneath you. Anything above 1 W gets a plain warning instead.

**Output power**, a separate slider filed with Calibrate Power, does the same
job for every *other* mode (FT8, CW, SSB, ...) — it has nothing to do with
WSPR's own declared level and doesn't appear on the WSPR page, since Declared
power always owns the radio there.

## Radio menus

The QMX's own menu system, on the Tab5's screen, over the radio's **second** USB
serial port — so CAT keeps running and the panadapter does not stop. Switch that
port on once, on the radio: **System config → GPS & Ser. ports → USB serial
ports → 2**. For a QMX+ with no control panel this is the only way into its
menus.

### Per-unit IF calibration

The QMX's +12 kHz IF injection varies slightly between units. If signals appear consistently shifted left or right of where the QMX is actually tuned, open the settings drawer → **IF calibration** slider (±100 Hz, persisted to NVS). Default 0. Reported by Ken KF0AYY, whose unit needed about −55 Hz to centre correctly.

### What works without the QMX connected

| Works without QMX | Needs QMX connected |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| UI, settings drawer, gestures | Spectrum + waterfall (no I/Q = flat line) |
| WiFi, web UI, screenshots | Top bar Band / Mode / BW |
| Callsign / grid / WiFi credentials | Tap-to-tune, mode popup (CAT writes) |
| Brightness, colour map, dB range | S-meter, FT8 decode/TX, QMX firmware readout |

If the spectrum is flat and the top bar shows `---`, that is almost always the radio not being seen over USB — which loops back to the cable (or the QMX being off / in flash mode).

### Spectrum signal shifted / mirrored, tunable across the whole 48 kHz window

This means the QMX never confirmed IQ mode for the session — without it the radio streams plain (non-IQ) audio instead of a centred baseband, so the signal appears at the wrong place and slides across the full 48 kHz window as you tune. As of v0.19.3 the Tab5 retries the IQ-mode handshake automatically at connect (up to 4 attempts) and this resolves itself almost every time; if it still fails after all retries, a red banner appears across the top of the screen telling you so immediately, instead of leaving you to figure it out from a shifted waterfall. If you see the banner, power-cycle the QMX (forces a fresh handshake on reconnect) or check the QMX's own **System Config → IQ Mode** setting.

### Reporting hardware issues

Near the top of the boot log you will see:

```
I (xxxx) bsp_info: === TAB5 BSP INFO ===
I (xxxx) bsp_info: chip:     ESP32-P4 rev v1.3
I (xxxx) bsp_info: psram:    30 MB
I (xxxx) bsp_info: panel:    ST7123 (inferred from touch)
I (xxxx) bsp_info: touch:    ST7123 @ 0x55
I (xxxx) bsp_info: heap:     230.5 kB internal free, 28.80 MB PSRAM free
I (xxxx) bsp_info: idf:      v5.4.4
I (xxxx) bsp_info: firmware: v0.21.0
I (xxxx) bsp_info: =====================
```

When opening a hardware issue, paste this block — the `panel` and `touch` lines are the first thing needed to identify which Tab5 hardware revision you have.

> **Note on `reset_reason`:** a deliberate reset-button force-off returns `panic/exception`, not `external-pin`/`power-on`. A genuine firmware crash always prints a `Guru Meditation` register + backtrace dump immediately *before* the reboot. No backtrace = abrupt power-off, not a crash.

## Build from source

Requires **ESP-IDF v5.4.4** — pinned; do not upgrade. ESP32-P4 v1.3 silicon requires `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_0=y` and CPU capped at 360 MHz, both baked into `sdkconfig`.

```powershell
# Activate the IDF environment, then:
idf.py build flash monitor
```

Or with the `qmx` PowerShell helper — add to your `$PROFILE` and adjust the COM port:

```powershell
function qmx {
    param([string]$cmd = "fm")
    if (-not $env:IDF_PATH) { & C:\esp\v5.4.4\esp-idf\export.ps1 }
    switch ($cmd) {
        "b"   { idf.py build }
        "f"   { idf.py flash }
        "m"   { python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
        "fm"  { idf.py flash; python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
        "bfm" { idf.py build flash; python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
    }
}
```

Exit monitor: `Ctrl+T` then `Ctrl+X`.

## Under the hood

### I/Q balance correction

The QMX presents I/Q audio with a small but measurable amplitude imbalance and quadrature error between channels. Without correction, every signal produces a mirror image across the centre frequency (~30 dB weaker), cluttering the waterfall on a busy band.

A blind adaptive Gram-Schmidt orthogonaliser runs sample-by-sample in the audio pipeline before the FFT. It maintains running estimates of:
- **DC offset** on each channel (τ = 1 s)
- **Power** in I and Q (τ = 200 ms)
- **Cross-product** I·Q (τ = 1 s) — non-zero cross-product means the channels are not orthogonal

Correction per sample:

```
i_out = i
q_out = (q − K_phi · i) × K_amp
```

No calibration step needed; the estimator converges on ambient band noise within a few seconds of any signal. A two-speed startup runs all alphas at 8× for the first 2 s of real signal after each reset (effective convergence ~125 ms), then drops to steady-state. Toggle in the settings drawer; re-enabling resets the estimator so it reconverges from a clean state.

### Quirks and trade-offs

**PI4IO expander must be initialised before display bring-up.** The Tab5's PI4IO I/O expander holds `LCD_RST` and `TP_RST` low at chip power-on. Without explicit init, on a true cold boot the panel never comes out of reset and the DSI FIFO hangs. Soft resets mask this because the expander retains state across ESP32 resets. `display_init` calls `bsp_i2c_init()` + `bsp_io_expander_pi4ioe_init()` first, then waits 120 ms.

**Patched components in `components/`.** `espressif__usb_host_uac/` has `create_background_task = true` — required for UAC and CDC-ACM to coexist on the same USB host. `espressif__esp_lcd_touch_st7123/` makes `FW_VERSION_REG` the only mandatory register read (ST7121 NACKs the others and also adds a `max_touches > 10` bounds clamp). Do not replace either with the registry version without re-applying the patches.

**LVGL software rotation (~50% FPS cost).** The panel is natively portrait; landscape is achieved via `lv_display_set_rotation(LV_DISPLAY_ROTATION_90)`. Every flush goes through `rotate90_rgb565`. ~13 fps landscape vs ~22 fps portrait — acceptable for a panadapter. PPA hardware rotation conflicts with the USB host stack over DW-GDMA channels and silently kills UAC + CDC-ACM; do not set `CONFIG_LVGL_PORT_ENABLE_PPA=y`. A full native-portrait rewrite would recover the lost FPS but isn't planned — accepted as a permanent trade-off.

**IDLE watchdog disabled.** The LVGL rotation pipeline keeps CPU0 busy past the default watchdog window. `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU0/CPU1` are off; the app-task watchdog (30 s) is still active.

**Cross-thread CAT writes must go through the poll task.** Writing CAT commands directly from the LVGL thread races the FA/MD/FW poll on the same CDC pipe — commands interleave and the QMX returns `?;`. Pattern: stash the request in a `volatile` and let `poll_task` drain it on its next cycle. See `s_pending_ssb_bw` / `cat_request_ssb_bandwidth()` in `cat.c`.

**SSB filter bandwidth needs three coordinated writes.** `MMSSB|Filter RX=<hz>;` commits the value (persists, shows in QMX menu); `MMSSB|Bandwidth=<hz>;` applies it live; `FW;` polling must be suspended while the width is pinned because reading the filter makes the QMX revert it. Dead ends: `FW<nnnn>;` CAT set returns `?;`; re-asserting the same mode digit does not reload the filter; `Bandwidth` write alone reverts on the next poll.

**HTTPS needs mbedtls allocating from PSRAM, not internal RAM.** The QRZ/eQSL upload features (v0.16.2) are this firmware's first-ever outbound HTTPS connections — SNTP, the only prior network client, is UDP. With the default `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_MEM_ALLOC_MODE=MBEDTLS_INTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC`, the TLS handshake's 16 KB+ buffers competed for the ~200 KB internal DRAM already under pressure from USB host/audio/FFT/LVGL and every connection failed with `ESP_ERR_HTTP_CONNECT`. Fixed by switching to `MBEDTLS_EXTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC` in `sdkconfig`, which moves those buffers into the 28 MB of free PSRAM instead.

## Roadmap

The full per-version changelog — every release from v0.1.0 onward — lives in **[docs/version-history.md](docs/version-history.md)**. This section tracks only what's planned next.

### Next up

**v1.15.0 is here.** Next on the bench:

- **Web-UI audio streaming.** Listen to the receiver in any browser on your LAN — demodulated on the Tab5, no PC. Already working in development; held back for quality tuning and an overnight streaming soak. Server mode (screen off, device just serves) rides along.
- **CW page.** Canned-message CW TX memories first; decoded-CW display after (the QMX decodes internally — mirroring it over CAT looks cheap).
- **Binaural CW audio.** Asked for by Roy KI0ER, and shaped by Don N2VGU and Michael KZ4LY: a stereo sound stage so two stations a few tens of hertz apart land in different places in your head, with the **stage width a setting** rather than a fixed angle. The DSP is small — the Tab5 already receives I and Q separately — but it needs the Tab5's own audio output path, which is the same rework the CW page waits on.

  Uwe DL8UG pointed at the KX2's "AFX MD Delay" — Elecraft's own quasi-stereo mode, a fixed delay on one channel applied to the whole receive audio, sold on *reducing operating fatigue* rather than separating signals. It's a genuinely different, much cheaper technique (no I/Q phase math, just a delay line) that solves comfort, not the "which station is where" separation the stage-width idea above targets. Worth keeping as a candidate first step or a companion to the real thing, not a replacement for it.
- **Tab5 audio output rework.** The blocker under both of the above: the output task must not run at all in FT8/FT4 (Michael KZ4LY's suggestion), since merely existing at a higher priority than the FFT consumer cost decode yield.

### Longer term

- **CW decoder.** Goertzel-based, text scrolling under the spectrum. The QMX already does this internally — question is whether to mirror its output via CAT or run a parallel decoder on the Tab5.
- **Tab5 speaker / headphone audio.** Demodulated CW/SSB passband audio out of the Tab5's own jack, so the operator can monitor without the QMX's audio path.
- **Extended waterfall history.** PSRAM has room for several minutes of scrollback; two-finger drag to scrub through history.
- **QDX / QDX-M support.** Asked for repeatedly. The QDX is I/Q over USB like the QMX, so
  receive is close; transmit needs a different route, because the QDX has no equivalent of
  the CAT tone command the Tab5 uses to key FT8. See `docs/qdx-vs-qmx-comparison.md`.
- **JS8 / RTTY modes.** See `docs/js8-feasibility.md` and `docs/rtty-feasibility.md`.
- **DSP polish.** Noise reduction, auto-notch.
