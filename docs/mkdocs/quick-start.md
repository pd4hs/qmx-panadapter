# Quick Start

Get your QMX Panadapter on air in 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **M5Stack Tab5** (ESP32-P4, 5" display)
- **QRP Labs QMX or QMX+** transceiver
- **USB-C power cable** (5 V / 2 A minimum)
- **USB-A to USB-C data cable** (connects Tab5 to QMX)
- **WiFi network** (optional, for remote control and logging)

## Step 1: Verify QMX Firmware

Power the QMX on standalone and check the firmware version displayed on its screen. You need **v1.03.002 or newer**. If yours is older, update the QMX first — everything that follows depends on recent firmware. Both **v1.03.002** and the **v1.04 betas** work with the panadapter; on v1.04 you additionally get **AM mode** and an **Antenna Tune** button (SWR tune with a live power/SWR readout). Both stay hidden on v1.03.002, so either firmware is fine.

## Step 2: Flash the Tab5

Download the latest flasher from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/releases):

=== "Windows"

    1. Plug Tab5 into your computer with a **USB-C data cable**
    2. Double-click `flash.bat`
    3. Press **Enter** for a normal flash (keeps your settings) or type **E** for a clean flash (wipes everything)
    4. Wait for `SUCCESS`

=== "macOS"

    1. Plug Tab5 into your computer with a **USB-C data cable**
    2. Open Terminal and run: `bash flash.command`
    3. If you haven't installed esptool: `brew install esptool`
    4. Press **Enter** for normal flash
    5. Wait for `SUCCESS`

=== "Linux"

    1. Plug Tab5 into your computer with a **USB-C data cable**
    2. Run: `bash flash.command`
    3. If you haven't installed esptool: `pip3 install esptool`
    4. Press **Enter** for normal flash
    5. Wait for `SUCCESS`

The firmware is already inside the zip — the three `.bin` files next to the script are what get flashed. The only thing fetched from the internet is `esptool`, once, if your computer doesn't already have it, so after the first successful run the flasher works offline.

## Step 3: Connect the Cables

You need **two USB connections**:

| Connection | Tab5 Port | Cable | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tab5 <- QMX | USB-A (host) | USB-A to USB-C, **data cable** | I/Q audio + CAT control |
| Tab5 <- Power | USB-C | Any USB-C power cable | 5V power |

⚠️ **Cable gotcha:** Many USB-C cables are charge-only. If the spectrum stays flat and the top bar shows `Band: ---`, you have a charge-only cable. Swap it for one you know does data (USB stick, phone sync, etc.).

## Step 4: Power On

1. **Tab5 first** — turn it on. The screen fades up gently from black as it loads.
2. **QMX second** — turn on the QMX. Until the radio is connected, the Tab5 shows a full-screen **"turn on / reboot your QMX"** prompt — that's normal, not a fault, and it clears automatically once the QMX is talking.
3. Within a few seconds the top bar should show Band / Mode / BW, and the spectrum should come alive

## Step 5: Fill in Your Settings

On first boot you'll be prompted for:

- **Callsign** — your amateur radio callsign
- **Grid** — your Maidenhead grid square (e.g., JO45)
- **WiFi** — SSID and password (optional, skip if you're portable)

You can change these anytime by swiping right from the screen edge to open the settings drawer.

## Step 5b: Optional — microSD Card (station backup)

Insert a microSD card (a plain **FAT32 32 GB** card is ideal) into the Tab5's slot and it automatically mirrors your whole station to `/qmx-panadapter/` on the card — a **grab-and-go backup** you can pull into a PC or another Tab5, no computer needed in the field:

- **ADIF QSO log** — mirrored after each new QSO
- **Config export** — all settings + memory channels (restore via the web **Config** upload)
- **LoTW certificate + key** — so a restored device can sign QSOs for LoTW
- **Diagnostic log** — rolling copy
- **README.txt** — describes every file on the card

The **SD** dot in the bottom status bar shows what is happening (absent = no card, which is not an error):

- **Green** — mirroring continuously. This is the case with **WiFi off**, i.e. normal POTA/SOTA operating.
- **Yellow** — your start-up backup is written and mirroring has stopped. This is the case with **WiFi on**: the card and the WiFi co-processor share a bus and can't both use it reliably, so the Tab5 takes the full backup within a few seconds of switching on and then leaves the card alone. QSOs made later in that session are written at the next start-up.

> **After inserting the SD card your Tab5 needs a restart.** The card is claimed during a short window early in boot, so one pushed in while the Tab5 is running isn't used until you restart it.

> ⚠️ The backup contains credentials (WiFi password, QRZ/eQSL logins, LoTW private key) — keep the card physically secure. Skipping this step is fine; your logs and settings always live in the device's own storage too.

## Step 6: Navigate the Screen

The entire app runs on **edge swipes and taps on the top bar**:

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| Swipe → from **left edge** | Cycle Panadapter -> FT8/FT4 -> WSPR |
| Swipe ← from **right edge** | Open settings drawer |
| Swipe ↑ from **bottom edge** | Open memory channel picker |
| Tap any **top bar item** | Open that item's selector (Freq, Mode, BW, etc.) |

You'll see faint "breathing" grip handles on the edges — they show you where to swipe.

## Step 7: Start Listening

You're now receiving. The **spectrum** shows signal strength across the band, and the **waterfall** scrolls down showing signal activity over time.

- **Tap the spectrum or waterfall** to tune to that frequency
- **Pinch** to zoom in/out; **one-finger horizontal drag** to pan and retune
- **Tap the coloured band-plan strip** (along the bottom, just above the status bar) to jump to a frequency, or **drag along it** to scrub through the band — you can also grab it from *anywhere on the bottom bar* and drag sideways (a vertical up-swipe there still opens memory channels)
- **Tap the Freq label** on the top bar to open the frequency keypad — drag the "Enter freq" title bar to reposition it, pinch or swipe up/down to resize it
- **Swipe ↑ from the bottom edge** to open memory channels — tap an empty slot to create one, long-press a filled slot to edit it, long-press and drag to move a channel (or drag it onto the **wastebin** cell to delete it). A new device comes with a few example channels and plays a one-time tour of these gestures the first time you open the picker
- **Tap Band** to switch between your configured bands
- **Tap Mode** to switch USB/LSB/CW/DiGi

## Step 8: FT8 Mode (Optional)

Swipe → from the left edge to switch to **FT8 view**. You'll see:

- **Live decode list** — all FT8 stations heard on frequency
- **Waterfall** — same real-time spectrum waterfall
- **Call CQ** button — transmit a CQ (requires QMX to be on the air)
- **Reply** rows — tap a station to reply to their CQ


## Step 9: WiFi & Web UI (Optional)

If you set up WiFi:

1. Open your browser to **`http://qmx.local`** (or the IP shown in the Tab5's bottom bar, if your network blocks `.local` names)
2. You'll see a remote spectrum, waterfall, and control panel — plus QSO log downloads and uploads to QRZ, eQSL, and LoTW
3. No installation or configuration needed — just open and go

## Step 10: Keeping It Up To Date

From v1.8.9 the Tab5 can update itself over WiFi. You do not need the cable
again unless something goes badly wrong. The version on the bottom bar turns
amber when a newer one exists; tap it, choose **Download now**, and then
**Restart now** when it suits you — nothing is fetched or installed until you
ask for it.

!!! warning "v1.15.0 needs a USB-C cable, once"

    v1.15.0 reclaims 2.81 MB of flash that had never been used, and that means
    rewriting the partition table — something an over-the-air update cannot do,
    by design. It is the only release that needs the cable, and afterwards
    over-the-air updates work as before, with more than twice the room.

    So v1.15.0 comes as a **flasher download**: the same USB-C data cable and
    the same script you used to install the firmware the first time.

    If you tap the update notice instead, it will simply fail — there is no
    over-the-air image to fetch, on purpose.

    **Your settings, memories, QSO log and LoTW certificate are kept.** Press
    **Enter** at the flash-type prompt — not **E**, which erases everything
    including your LoTW private key.

    You will not have to remember this. When that release appears, the update
    window tells you instead of offering a download.

When a newer release is available, the version at the bottom of the screen
changes to show it, in light green, and breathes gently so you notice it:

```
v1.14.3 -> v1.14.4 ?
```

Tap the bar — anywhere along it — and a window opens in the middle of the
screen with the version and two buttons:

- **Download now** — the download runs in the background while the spectrum,
  waterfall and FT8 decoding keep working. Expect a slight stutter and one brief
  pause right at the end while the new firmware is verified.
- **Dismiss** — the window closes. The line stays, quietly, and tapping it opens
  the window again whenever you are ready.

While the download runs the window shows the percentage:

```
Downloading  42%
```

When it finishes, the same window offers **Restart now** — the screen goes dark
and the Tab5 comes back on the new firmware, about 20 seconds.

Nothing is fetched until you press **Download now**, and nothing restarts until
you press **Restart now**. It can never interrupt a contact.

The same window is available from the web page, in the same words.

### Checking straight away

The Tab5 looks for a new release **every 30 minutes**, so an announcement can
take that long to show up. If you have just read that a release is out and want
to see it now, **tap the version even while it says you are up to date**. The
window offers **Check now**. Tapping the version in the web page does the same.

That is also the quickest way to satisfy yourself the whole mechanism works
before you ever need it.

Your settings, QSO log, LoTW certificate and memories are untouched by an
update. The previous firmware is also kept, so a failed update falls back to it
by itself.

⚠ Restarting the Tab5 with the QMX connected usually means switching the radio
off and on again afterwards — the screen will tell you if so.

## Troubleshooting

**Spectrum is flat?**
- Check the USB cable between Tab5 and QMX — charge-only cables won't work
- Verify QMX is powered on and not in standby
- Restart both devices (Tab5 first, then QMX)

**QMX doesn't appear?**
- Check QMX firmware version (Step 1 above) — should be v1.03.002 or newer (the v1.04 betas also work)
- Try a different USB cable

**Flashing keeps failing, but the COM port is there?**
- **Reboot the Tab5 and try again — do this first.** The Tab5's USB serial connection is produced by the ESP32-P4 itself rather than by a separate chip, so a busy running firmware can leave the port listed in Windows Device Manager while it no longer answers the flasher. A reboot clears it.
- Then the usual suspects: a charge-only USB-C cable, or a serial monitor still holding the port.

**WiFi won't connect?**
- Check your SSID and password spelling
- Restart the Tab5 and try again
- See [Troubleshooting](reference/troubleshooting.md) for more

**Still stuck?**
- **Ask the Tab5 first.** Open the settings drawer (swipe in from the right edge) and tap **Need guidance?** — pick the symptom in plain words and it opens the manual at the answer. Anything the device can see for itself is highlighted at the top of that list. See [Getting Help](getting-help.md)
- The **diagnostic log is always on** — nothing to enable. Download it via the web UI: open the **Files** menu in the web page's bottom bar and click **Diagnostic download ↓** (downloads both the live log and the saved pre-reboot copy), or pull `qmx-log.txt` from an inserted microSD card
- Report the issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/issues) or the [QRPLabs Groups.io thread](https://groups.io/g/QRPLabs/topic/119565643) and attach the log
